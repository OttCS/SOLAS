These are innate abilities, results of upbringing, or gifts that your character could have. These do not define all that your character is, only aspects. Feel free to include as much character background detail as you'd like, or create your own! It is up to GM discretion to allow or deny lineage options, but as a rule of thumb .

# Lifestyle
Lifestyle options reflect the skills that one develops based on their upbringing.

## Athlete
When you have to roll a **Strength** check, you gain advantage.

*You've been raised to depend on your physical strength, in and out of combat.*

## Far Traveler
You have advantage on **Constitution**.

*You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous tales.*

## Sage
You have advantage on **Mind** checks.

*You've spent your time pouring over every detail in your area of research, memorizing every intricacy of the field.*

## Runaway
You have advantage on **Dexterity** checks.

*Staying on the outskirts of society, you had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.*

# Innate
Innate options are characteristics that one is born with.

## Darkvision
You have superb vision in the dark, being raised in it or naturally gifted. Your character can see up to 6 tiles away in darkness, in shades of gray.

*This may manifest if the form of non-human eyes, such as cat pupils or glowing irises*

## Celestial Lineage
You are resistant to one celestial damage type (Radiant, Necrotic, Force, or Psychic) of your choice, which cannot be changed later. You also roll with advantage when attacking with this type of damage.

*Your power may come from deities, psions, or something else entirely. This usually manifests in a shifted palette, gold for celestials, reds for devils, purples for psions, etc.*

## Elemental Lineage
You are resistant to one elemental damage type (Poison, Fire, Cold, or Lightning) of your choice, which cannot be changed later. You also roll with advantage when attacking with this type of damage.

*Your power may come from primordials, dragons, or something else entirely. This usually manifests in a shifted palette, dealing in reds and oranges for fire, etc.*

## Twilit
You no longer need to sleep to fully recover heart, instead only requiring 4 hours of concious meditation.

*This may be the result of exposure to the feywild, underdark, or similar place. Your skin may sparkle in the right light, some animalistic features may manifest (satyrs, for example), flowers may bloom/wilt around you depending on your mood, or similar flavoring.*
