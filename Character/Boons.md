A boon is something that is a unique skill that shapes how your character interacts with the world. Some boons have requirements, and characters that don't meet these cannot get the boon.

# Elemental Shift
When you attack with a physical weapon, you can spend a focus point to change its damage type to an elemental one. This effect persists through combat, and you can spend another **focus** to re-roll the type. To do this, roll a d6:

|1|2|3|4|5|6|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|Poison|Fire|Cold|Lightning|Your choice|

# Soul Collector
Once per turn, when you use a trick that reduces the target's heart, roll R1. At the start of your next turn, you regain the number of successes as additional **Focus**.

# Tinkering
You are able to improve and change everyday objects to suit your needs. By spending 1 Stamina and 1 Focus, you may touch an object and give it one of the following properties.
- The object sheds bright light in a 1-tile radius and dim light for an additional tile.
- The object emits a 6-second recorded message that can be heard up to 2 tiles away (you must say this message when you touch the object)
- The object continuously emits and odor or a nonverbal sound, percievable up to 2 tiles away.
- The object's surface shows what you trace with your finger.

# Willbreaker
When you do damage to a creature and its resistance drops to 0, you can spend focus points to roll further psychic damage against it, 1R per focus point.
