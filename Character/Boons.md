A boon is something that is a unique skill that shapes how your character interacts with the world. Some boons have requirements, and characters that don't meet these cannot get the boon.

**Physical**: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing
**Elemental**: Poison, Fire, Cold, Lightning
**Celestial**: Radiant, Necrotic, Force, Psychic

# Darkvision
Your character has superb vision in the dark, being raised in it or naturally gifted. Your character can see up to 6 tiles away in darkness, in shades of gray.

# Celestial Lineage
Somewhere in your ancestry is a source of celestial power, whether from deities, psions, or something else entirely. You are resistant to one celestial damage type (Radiant, Necrotic, Force, or Psychic) of your choice, which cannot be changed later. You also roll with advantage when attacking with this type of damage.

# Elemental Lineage
Somewhere in your ancestry is a source of elemental power, whether from dragons, primordials, or something else entirely. You are resistant to one elemental damage type (Poison, Fire, Cold, or Lightning) of your choice, which cannot be changed later. You also roll with advantage when attacking with this type of damage.

# Elemental Shift
When you attack with a physical weapon, you can spend a focus point to change its damage type to an elemental one. This effect persists through combat, and you can spend another **focus** to re-roll the type. To do this, roll a d6:

|1|2|3|4|5|6|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|Poison|Fire|Cold|Lightning|Your choice|

# Soul Collector
Once per turn, when you use a trick that reduces the target's heart, roll R1. At the start of your next turn, you regain the number of successes as additional **Focus**.

# Tinkering
You are able to improve and change everyday objects to suit your needs. By spending 1 Stamina and 1 Focus, you may touch an object and give it one of the following properties.
- The object sheds bright light in a 1-tile radius and dim light for an additional tile.
- The object emits a 6-second recorded message that can be heard up to 2 tiles away (you must say this message when you touch the object)
- The object continuously emits and odor or a nonverbal sound, percievable up to 2 tiles away.
- The object's surface shows what you trace with your finger.

# Willbreaker
When you do damage to a creature and its resistance drops to 0, you can spend focus points to roll further psychic damage against it, 1R per focus point.
