A boon is something that is a unique skill that shapes your character. Your GM decides when to award boons, but each player gets to select a boon of their choice.

## Elemental Shift
When you attack with a physical weapon, you can spend a focus point to change its damage type to an elemental one. This effect persists through combat, and you can spend another **focus** to re-roll the type. To do this, roll a d6:

|1|2|3|4|5|6|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|Acid|Fire|Cold|Lightning|Your choice|

## Soul Collector
Once per turn, when you use a trick that reduces the target's heart, roll R1. At the start of your next turn, you regain the number of successes as additional **Focus**.

## Willbreaker
When you do damage to a creature and its resistance drops to 0, you can spend a focus point to give the creature disadvantage on attacks against you until the end of your next turn.
