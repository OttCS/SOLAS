A boon is something that is a unique skill that shapes how your character interacts with the world, that they have acquired throughout their journey. Some boons have requirements, and characters that do not meet these cannot recieve the boon.

# Elemental Shift
When you attack with a physical weapon, you can spend a focus point to change its damage type to an elemental one. This effect persists through combat, and you can spend another **focus** to re-roll the type. To do this, roll a d6:

|1|2|3|4|5|6|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|Poison|Fire|Cold|Lightning|Your choice|

# Second Wind
Once per rest, you may fully recover your resistance, as well as your stamina points.

# Soul Collector
Once per turn, when you use a trick that reduces the target's heart, roll R1. At the start of your next turn, you regain the number of successes as additional **Focus**.

# Well Armored
Your **strength** is considered to be one higher when meeting an armor requirement

# Willbreaker
When you do damage to a creature and its resistance drops to 0, you can spend focus points to roll further psychic damage against it, 1R per focus point.
