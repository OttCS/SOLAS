For simplicity's sake, the character creation process begins at "level zero" with a generic character. This character has a 1 in each of the primary attributes.

Each time you gain a level (including level one!) add a point to a primary attribute of your choosing. Additionally, starting at level 1, every 4 levels you also gain a boon.
