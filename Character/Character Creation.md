Character creation is a fantastic process where you can let your creativity run wild!

# Starting
For simplicity's sake, the character creation process begins at "level zero" with a generic character. This character has a 1 in each of the primary attributes. This is when you choose your lineage and innate abilities.

## Abilities
These are innate abilities or gifts that your character has. When creating your character, you may choose two of these

**Darkvision**
- Your character has superb vision in the dark, being raised in it or naturally gifted. Your character can see up to 6 tiles away in darkness, in shades of gray.

**Celestial Lineage**
- Somewhere in your ancestry is a source of celestial power, whether from deities, psions, or something else entirely. You are resistant to one celestial damage type (Radiant, Necrotic, Force, or Psychic) of your choice, which cannot be changed later. You also roll with advantage when attacking with this type of damage.

**Elemental Lineage**
- Somewhere in your ancestry is a source of elemental power, whether from dragons, primordials, or something else entirely. You are resistant to one elemental damage type (Poison, Fire, Cold, or Lightning) of your choice, which cannot be changed later. You also roll with advantage when attacking with this type of damage.

# Leveling Up
Each time you gain a level (including level one!) add a point to a primary attribute of your choosing. Additionally, starting at level 1, every 4 levels you also gain a boon (1, 5, 9, etc.)
