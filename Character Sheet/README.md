# How to Print

The [[Printable.pdf]] had a lot of time and effort put into it to make sure that it would be easily printed in many situations.

The margins are baked into the pdf, make sure you do not add in additional margins when printing.

If you only require one sheet, you can print it in landscape format with spells on the right side. To save paper with multiple characters (because how are you playing this by yourself?) you can print sheets front and back (flipped on the SHORT edge), and then cut them in half!
