# Combat
Players typically end up in some sort of fight, and this bestiary is here to flesh out encounters with interesting enemies. When using the enemies, feel free to keep track of stamina points for them. As an easier rule, a creature can take as many actions per turn as its **Constitution** score, up to three.

# About Challenge Scores
Balancing combat is a tricky thing to do, especially given the amount of possible player combinations there are. Each creature here has a **Challenge** score, which describes the level of a party that it is an appropriate challenge for. A standard party is considered to be 4 players, but creatures can be scaled for more or fewer players by reducing/increasing the health. Any attacks which specify multiple times per turn are limited to once per player if there are multiple targets within range.

|Challenge Rating|Appropriate For|
|-|-|
|1/4|One (1) player|
|1/2|Two (1) players|
|1|Four (1) players, Two (2) players|
|2|Four (2) players, Two (3) players|

# Centaur
*Wanderers of blasted wastelands, centaur tribes are nomadic hunters who defend their chosen families and territory fiercly. Most were raised in constant threat of other tribes or encroaching humanoids, and carry that distrust and combat readiness with them for the rest of their lives. Those who live for battle gain the status folk heroes, and are referred to across the varied tribes as The Warhungered*

`Do not find yourself running from centaurs, as they will catch up.`

# Dryad
*Dryads are tree spirits, chaotic and mischevious souls set to the task of protecting nature. While they're unlikely to stick around to chat, adventurers who get on a dryad's bad side typically avoid forests afterward, if they make it out at all.*

`A group of Dryads is called a tangle. How fitting!`

# Kulgeli
*The Kulgeli is an intelligent nocturnal predator who seeks out isolated creatures and ensnares them with roots and vines. Some towns that border forests or swamps share stories of a gargantuan creature who blends in with the trees and patiently waits for those foolish enough to wander away. When morning comes, those who go looking find a skeleton with clean bones strung up in a tangle of vines, with the victim's belongings in a neat pile below them.*

***Notes**: While unmoving, it takes a **Mind Check (3)** to spot the Kulgeli.*

`Out past the witching, vines shiver from rest. The vined one awaits a fresh dinner guest.`

# Midas Beetle
*Midas Beetles live in colonies deep in the earth, which can be mistaken for veins of gold in the rock. Usually found in underground caverns or by miners on accident, their bite hardens the surrounding flesh into a material similar to their carapace. A bite subsides after a day or so, but a multitude can cause temporary paralysis, or even death if the bites reach vital organs. Tales are told about unfortunate explorers or miners who fell into a colony and were unable to get out before being untirely covered in bites.*

`There's an old tale of a King Midas whose touch turned things gold. Perhaps he thought it would make a better story than admitting his castle had an infestation of these.`

# Werewolf
*Humanoids afflicted with a terrible curse take the form of wolves when threatened, or during exposure to the moon. While most flee and try to live out a peaceful life on the outer edges of society, some manage to keep their curse a secret and continue to live amongst others. The more times a werewolf transforms, however, the more of a wolf hybrid they become, with sharper teeth, yellowed eyes, and an elongated face.*

***Notes**: Resistant to physical damage from non-silver weapons*

`Howling at the moon, the gold-eyed wolfman prowls, hunting for a bite`
