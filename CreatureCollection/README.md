# About Challenge Scores
Balancing combat is a tricky thing to do, especially given the amount of possible player combinations there are. Each creature here has a **Challenge** score, which describes the party that this is an appropriate challenge for. The score is written as Players-Level, where Players is the number of players in the party and Level is the average party level. A score of 2/1 means 2 players at level 1, while a score of 4/5 means 4 players at level five. You can include multiple creatures in a fight, just consider how many players there are per enemy.

# Dryad
*Dryads are tree spirits, chaotic and mischevious souls set to the task of protecting nature.*

# Midas Beetle
*Midas Beetles live in colonies deep in the earth, which can be mistaken for veins of gold in the rock. Usually found in underground caverns or by miners on accident, their bite hardens the surrounding flesh into a material similar to their carapace. A bite subsides after a day or so, but a multitude can cause temporary paralysis, or even death if the bites reach vital organs. Tales are told about unfortunate explorers or miners who fell into a colony and were unable to get out before being untirely covered in bites.*
