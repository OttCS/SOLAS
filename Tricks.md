Tricks have dynamic costs, associated with their mental difficulty. While these are flavored as fantasy spells, feel free to flavor the tricks for your setting.

Each spell costs 1 stamina to cast, as well as its associated focus cost, regardless of the damage dealt. If you don't have enough focus OR stamina, you cannot use it. Some spells require concentration, meaning that if your heart is reduced (resistance doesn't count) or cast another spell, the effect ends.

When you go to use a trick, you can elect to spend extra Focus points beyond the normal cost. For each additional Focus point you spend, you roll an additional d6.
