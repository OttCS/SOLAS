Tricks have dynamic costs, associated with their mental difficulty. While these are flavored as fantasy spells, feel free to flavor the tricks for your setting.

This tricks represent things that a character can do without any effort.

## Fire Bolt
*Range: 10 Tiles*

You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isnâ€™t being worn or carried.

## Ray of Frost
*Range: 5 Tiles*
*2d6 Cold*
A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. If it reduces the target's HP, its speed is reduced by 2 tiles until the start of your next turn.

## Shocking Grasp
*Range: Melee*

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal.

## Toll the Dead
*Range: 5 Tiles*
