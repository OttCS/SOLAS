Most TTRPGs are broken down into a cycle of play, but this is by no means a one-size fits all solution. Generally, a GM will describe the environment, and the players respond with what their character does. The GM then goes back and forth with the players, narrating the results of their actions and having the players respond, until a scene comes to a natural close.

## Combat
Struggle is a part of every story, and it may present itself in the form of combat. Your characters have specific strengths and weaknesses based on your primary attributes. To start combat, everybody (including the GM's characters) make dexterity checks, where play goes highest to lowest according to the number of successes (this can be changed to play continues to the right, for convenience).

## Resting
Your characters cannot stay awake indefinitely, and will need to recover and heal their wounds. Characters will need to rest for a total of 8 hours, up to two of which can be sitting/lying down but concious. If characters go 24 hours without resting, they gain a **point of exhaustion**. Resting removes all points of exhaustion.

## Exhaustion
This comes when a character has undergone such a heavy burden (being awake for too long, physical exertion, or sustaining too much damage). There are different degrees of exhaustion, and they correspond with how many **points of exhaustion** that you have. For each point of exhaustion you've accumulated:

- You recover one less stamina and focus at the start of your turns (to a minimum of zero).
- Your speed is reduced by one tile (to a minimum of zero).

Exhaustion is not removed by healing. Only resting does this.

### On a Turn
It's your time to shine! Your character starts their turn by recovering some of their **Focus** and **Stamina** points (up to their maximum) the amount you recover of each is equal to your **Constitution**.

Now you're ready to go! You can take any of the following actions for the cost of 1 stamina point:

- Moving a distance up to your speed
- Attacking with a weapon (you must be on an adjacent square to do so with a melee weapon, or the target must be within range for a ranged weapon)

You can also use a spell for the cost of one **Stamina** point, as well as the listed **focus** cost for the spell.

If you do not have enough stamina and/or focus to take an action, you cannot do it.

### Opportunity Attacks
If a creature leaves your melee range, you can make a melee attack against it, provided you have enough stamina to do so.

### Resistances/vulnerabilities
Some enemies or characters may be resistant or vulnerable to certain types of damage (see **Damage Types** in the [Introduction](#introduction). If something is vulnerable to a type of attack, count your successes with advantage. If something is resistant to the type of attack, count the successes with disadvantage.

### Fading
Once your character reaches 0 heart, their grip on mortality is weakening and could soon die. On the start of your turn when you're fading, you gain a point of exhaustion. If you end your turn with three points of exhaustion, your character dies.

If you take damage while fading, consider your heart to be negative. Healing must bring you back up above 0 for you to be no longer fading.
