Most TTRPGs are broken down into a cycle of play, but this is by no means a one-size fits all solution. Generally, a GM will describe the environment, and the players respond with what their character does. The GM then goes back and forth with the players, narrating the results of their actions and having the players respond, until a scene comes to a natural close.

## Combat
Struggle is a part of every story, and it may present itself in the form of combat. Your characters have specific strengths and weaknesses based on your primary attributes. To start combat, everybody (including the GM's characters) make dexterity checks, where play goes highest to lowest according to the number of successes (this can be changed to play continues to the right, for convenience).

### On a Turn
It's your time to shine! Your character starts their turn by recovering some of their **Focus** and **Stamina** points (up to their maximum) the amount you recover of each is equal to your **Constitution**.

Now you're ready to go! You can take any of the following actions for the cost of 1 stamina point:

- Moving a distance up to your speed
- Attacking with a weapon (you must be on an adjacent square to do so with a melee weapon, or the target must be within range for a ranged weapon)

You can also use a spell for the cost of one **Stamina** point, as well as the listed **focus** cost for the spell.

If you do not have enough stamina and/or focus to take an action, you cannot do it.

### Opportunity Attacks
If a creature leaves your melee range, you can make a melee attack against it, provided you have enough stamina to do so.

### Resistances/vulnerabilities
Some enemies or characters may be resistant or vulnerable to certain types of damage (see **Damage Types** in the [Introduction](#introduction). If something is vulnerable to a type of attack, count your successes with advantage. If something is resistant to the type of attack, count the successes with disadvantage.

### Fading
Once your character reaches 0 heart, you begin fading. This means your character is losing their grip on mortality, and will soon die. Once you reach 0 heart, continuing to fight is dangerous. At the start of each of your turns, you lose a heart. Additionally, you can choose to lose an extra heart to take your normal turn, being any number of actions up to your current stamina/focus. Once you reach -5 heart, your character falls and dies.

## Resting
Once combat comes to a close, your focus and stamina are restored. However, your characters cannot stay awake indefinitely, and will need to recover from the physical exertion of the battle. Characters will need to rest for a total of 8 hours, up to two of which can be sitting/lying down. If characters go 24 hours without resting, they receive disadvantage on all checks due to exhaustion, and their speed is halved.
