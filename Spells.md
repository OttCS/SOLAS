There is magic out in the world, and some have been able to hone their minds to channel and control it to suite thier needs. Primary spells are easily learnable, and for the most part scalable (meaning that they're able to grow as your character does). Secondary Spells require more concentration and are more difficult to master, but in the right hands can be quite useful.

A character can only memorize a certain number of spells at a time, this being your **Mind** score. The ones you have memorized can be swapped during rests, but if you don't have a spell prepared, you cannot use it. Keep in mind that spells cost **focus** to use: a spell that requires more focus than your maximum simply cannot be memorized.

Each spell costs 1 stamina to cast, as well as its associated focus cost, regardless of the damage dealt. If you don't have enough focus OR stamina, you cannot use it. Some spells require concentration, meaning that if your heart is reduced, or you cast another spell, the spell ends. You can use at most one spell per turn.

***Scalable***. Some spells are scalable, which means they can be improved by spending more focus. The scalable description explains how the spell improves for each additional point you spend.

## Primary Spells
*Requires 2 Mind, Costs 2 Focus*

These spells represent things that a character can do with little concentration.

### Dancing Lights
- **Concentration**

You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a two-tile radius. On your turn, you can move each light up to 60 feet to a new spot within range.

### Entangle

### Guiding Bolt
- Range: 6 Tiles
- Scalable: +R2

A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range, doing **R2 Radiant** damage. The next attack against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.

### Mage Hand
- **Concentration**
- Range: 12 Tiles

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 12 tiles away from you.

You can use **one Stamina** to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 6 tiles each time you use it.

The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

### Minor Illusion
- **Concentration**
- Range: 6 Tiles
- Duration: 1 Minute
- Scalable: +1 Tile size

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. If a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a yell, and can be a perfect imitation of any sound you have heard before. If an image, it must be contained within a one-tile space. An illusion can spotted with a **contested Mind Check**.

### Ray of Frost
- Range: 6 Tiles
- Scalable: +R1 and target's speed - 1 tile

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range, dealing **R2 cold** damage. If it reduces the target's HP, its speed is halved until the start of your next turn.

### Shocking Grasp
- Range: 1 Tile
- Scalable: +R2

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch, dealing **R3 Lightning**. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal.

### Thaumaturgy

-   You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
-   You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.

-   You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.

### Toll the Dead
- Range: 6 Tiles
- Scalable: +R2

### Wither and Bloom
- Range: 12 Tiles
- Scalable: +R1 and radius + 1

You weaken the veil between life and death at a point within range. In a radius of 2 tiles, each creature of your choice takes **R2 Necrotic** damage. Additionally, a creature of your choice within the radius gains heart equal to the number of creatures who took damage.

### Word of Radiance
- Range: 2 Tile
- Scalable: +R1 and radius + 1

You utter a divine word, and burning radiance erupts around you, dealing **R2 Radiant** to each creature within range.

***Thunderclap (Variant)**. The burning radiance is replaced with thunderous sound. This deals **Force** damage.*

### Vicious Mockery
- Range: 12 Tiles
- Scalable: +R2

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range that can hear you. The creature takes **R3 Psychic** damage, reduced by the number of successes they make on a **Mind Check**

***Dissonant Whispers (Variant)**. The string of insults is replaced with a discordant melody, striking fear into the target. This deals **R2 Psychic** damage, but if the target loses heart, they immediately spend one stamina (if available) to move as far as its speed allows away from you (not into obviously dangerous territory)*

## Secondary Spells
*Requires 3 Mind, Costs 3 Focus*

These spells represent things that a character can do with some effort.

### Bane
- **Concentration**
- Range: 6 Tiles
- Scalable: +1 target

Up to three creatures of your choice make **Mind Checks vs Your Mind**. Creatures who fail roll with disadvantage when attacking or making a check.

### Bless
- **Concentration**
- Range: 6 Tiles
- Scalable: +1 target

You bless up to three willing creatures of your choice. When blessed, creatures roll one more dice when attacking or making a check.

### Crescendo
- **Concentration**
- Range: 6 Tiles
- Scalable: +1 Creature (they both have the same primary attribute scaled)

When you cast this spell, you select a primary attribute of a creature you can see within range to boost. If you use this attribute for a check or attack before the end of your next turn, you roll an additional die. For up to the next two consecutive turns, you may continue adding an additional dice.

### Crown of Madness
- **Concentration**
- Range: 12 Tiles

You target one humanoid within range, and they must succeed on a **Contested Mind Check** or become charmed by you for the duration. While charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on the target's head, and madness gleams in their eyes.

The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.

On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Additionally, the target can make another **Contested Mind Check** at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.

### Disguise Self
- **Concentration**
- Duration: 1 hour

You can make yourself appear as a different race, gender, height, and weight, and even change their voice.

### Hellish Rebuke
- **Concentration**
- Scalable: +R2

You channel the power of the lower planes, surrounding yourself in flames. Until you lose heart, you can add **R1 Fire** damage to melee attacks. When you do take damage (before concentration ends), the flames engulf your attacker, dealing **R3 Fire** damage.

### Hex
- **Concentration**

You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, you deal an additional **R1 Necrotic** to the target whenever you reduce its heart.

### Identify
- Range: 1 Tile
You choose one object that you must touch while the casting the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any.

### Siren's Call
- **Concentration**
- Range: 6 Tiles
- Scalable: +1 target, check +1

A hauntingly beautiful melody fills the air around the caster (optionally sung by them) that steals the will of enemies. Three creatures within range make **Mind Checks (2)**, and those who fail can only spend stamina to move towards the caster.

### Witch Bolt
- **Concentration**
- Range: 6 Tiles
- Scalable: +R2 **Note:** Scaling the spell does not increase the cost to deal additional damage.

A beam of crackling energy lances out towards a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. The target takes **R4 Lightning** damage. If the target's heart is reduced, the lightning arc stays connected. On each of your following turns (until the creature dies, you lose concentration, or the target leaves the range), you can spend **one Focus** to deal **R2 Lightning** to the creature.

### Zorin's Forge
- **Concentration**

The caster summons a spectral melee weapon of their choice (i.e. sword, axe, etc.) The summoned weapon is semi-transparent and emits dim light for one tile, and lasts until the end of combat (unless dispelled or dismissed first). Attacking with weapon deals damage based on strength, but deals **Force** damage instead of the weapon's original type and is not limited by the weapon's size

## Tertiary Spells
*Requires 5 Mind, Costs 5 Focus*

### Telekinesis
- **Concentration** up to 10 minutes
- Range: 24 Tiles

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

**Creature.** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make a **Mind Check** contested by the creature's **Strength check**. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.

On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

**Object.** You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make a **Mind Check vs Their Strength** contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.
