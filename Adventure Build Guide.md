***Universe***. This includes the time period, the bounds of where your players can go. For a desert survival setting, the universe could be 1940s in the Sahara desert. Your players don't have to explore the entire bounds of your location, but it's a great place to start.

***Theming***. The products of the time period chosen. A golden age of piracy theme will have cutlasses, blunderbus pistols, and goofy tricorn hats, but an ancient Egyptian theme will have kopeshes, slings, and maybe even a touch of magic.

***Actors***. This are singular or groups of people who affect the world in a way which helps or hurts others. A collection of states bent on subjugation, a group researching extraplanar entities, a popular social icon with ulterior motives, etc.

***Goal***. The end goal you'd like your players to achieve (in the story, not just having a fun time hanging out). This generally depends on the theming and actors. In a cyberpunk setting, this might be taking down a mega-corporation who's been keeping the people supressed, but in a zombie apocalypse it may be saving a city from an internal, monstrous corruption by finding a cure.

***Scenes***. Individual locations which players can visit on their adventure. A school of magic could have catacombs beneath it, a haunted library, classrooms, etc. A good rule of thumb for making a scene is to have at least one social interaction and one reward or pitfall.

# Weapons
Each universe will have a different theme, and a different means of doing damage. These are some generic-enough weapon categories that can be used to provide options for your characters.

# Tricks
Tricks can be spells, special tacticals, etc. that provide interesting effects or damage at the cost of solace.
