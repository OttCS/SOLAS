A boon is something that is a unique skill that shapes how your character interacts with the world, that they have acquired throughout their journey. Which boons you can take are determined by if you already have the required prerequisite ones.

You get to choose one boon when you create your character, as well as an additional boon every three levels after that (levels four, seven, ten, thirteen, sixteen, and nineteen).
