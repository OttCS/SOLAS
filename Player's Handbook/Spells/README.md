There is magic out in the world, and some have been able to hone their minds to channel and control it to suite their needs. Basic spells are easily learnable, and for the most part scalable (meaning that they're able to grow as your character does). Advanced Spells require more concentration and are more difficult to master, but in the right hands can be quite useful. Expert Spells can only by mastered by those who spend ages honing their connection to magic.

A character can only memorize a certain number of spells at a time, this being your **Mind** score. The ones you have memorized can be swapped during rests, but if you don't have a spell prepared, you cannot use it. Most spellcasters have a few favored spells, but feel free to get creative!

Each spell costs 1 stamina to cast, as well as its associated focus cost, regardless of the damage dealt. If you don't have enough focus OR stamina, you cannot use it. A spell that requires more focus than your maximum simply cannot be memorized. Some spells require concentration, meaning that if your heart is reduced, or you cast another spell, the spell ends. You can use at most one spell per turn.

***Scalable***. Some spells are scalable, which means they can be improved by spending more focus. The scalable description explains how the spell improves for each additional focus point you spend.
