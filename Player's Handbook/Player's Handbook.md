# Introduction
Welcome to SOLAS! It's a rules system for running tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) that anybody can pick up and play. TTRPGs are about getting together with others and letting a story play out, with players controlling characters of their own creation.

To play, you'll need more than two people (one of whom is the Game Master, referred to as the GM), a way to take notes, and at least one standard six-sided die. Other materials are nice to have (like more d6s, some way to take notes), but are certainly not needed.

## Rolling
A die roll is when someone rolls at least one standard six-sided die to determine an outcome. A roll of four or higher is a success (a six is worth two successes), meaning a three or lower is a failure. The “result” of a roll is how many total successes there are. In these rules, rolls are indicated in these rules by an **R**, followed by a number such as R1, R4, etc. The **R** indicates a roll, and the number after it is the number of dice that you are rolling.

Sometimes a roll is specified as “advantaged” which means dice rolls succeed on a 3 or higher. Another variant is “disadvantaged” which means dice rolls succeed on a 5 or higher. Rolling a 6 is always considered to be 2 successes. Advantages and disadvantages don't stack, you can only be "advantaged" or "disadvantaged" and any amount of each cancels out.

Rolls can be used to determine damage, healing, or checks of your abilities. The weapon, spell, or GM will describe what you are trying to accomplish and what attribute you will be using.

## Checks
A check is when you rely on a particular skill to determine an outcome. If your GM calls for a Dexterity Check (perhaps you've activated a trap!), you would roll a number of dice equal to your dexterity score, and count your successes. If you meet or exceed the difficulty of the check, you succeed!

Checks can also be **contested**. This is where a character attempts a roll against someone else's score. If the character gets more successes that the score they're against, they succeed! These checks will be written as **Attribute Check vs Attribute**.

## Damage Types
SOLAS contains many different damage types for different weapons and spells. This list can be expanded upon for your needs, but the standard categories as follows:

- **Physical**: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing
- **Elemental**: Acid, Poison, Fire, Cold, Lightning
- **Celestial**: Radiant, Necrotic, Force, Psychic

## Point Pools
These are points you can save up to spend attacking, moving, or doing spells. When combat ends, these are returned to their maximum.

**Focus** is your mental concentration at any given moment. These points are used up when you use spells and certain abilities, and some are given back at the start of each turn.

**Stamina** is your physical ableness at any given moment. These points are used up when you move or attack, and some are given back at the start of each turn. Every character has 3 stamina points.

## Primary Attributes
Characters in the game have different attributes to describe their general skills. The number associated with each attribute is its relative effectiveness, 1 being the minimum possible. The categories are as follows:

### Strength
*Natural athleticism, physical power*

Your strength limits what armor you can wear. Ask your GM if you are allowed to start with armor, or if armor will be available in their setting.

### Dexterity
*Physical agility, reflexes, precision*

Your **dexterity** affects your **speed**. This is equal to four plus your **dexterity** score.

### Constitution
*Physical/Mental toughness, persistence*

Your **constitution** affects your **heart** (also referred to as health and/or hit points). This is equal to your **constitution** score times your level, plus five.

### Mind
*Analytical skill, intuition*

Your **mind** score is your amount of **focus** (the amount of which you have at the start of combat).

Your **mind** also affects what spells you know. A character can only memorize a certain number of spells at a time, this being your **mind**. The ones you have memorized can be swapped during rests, but if you don't have a spell prepared, you cannot use it. Characters with a **Mind** score higher than one can use **spells**, so check out the section to make sure you know your character's options.

## Tiles
A tile is typically a square or hexagon on a grid, and is considered to be 5 feet (or 1.5 meters). While you may not be playing with an actual grid at all, this still describes specific distances for spells, ranges, and movement.

# Creating a Character
To play this game, each player must create a character, a member of the setting that the GM is describing. SOLAS is designed to have very a simple character creation system, but one that lets creativity run wild. The easiest way to create a character is to break it down into two parts: Before they became an adventurer, and where they are now. Doing this naturally flows with the character creation process. The first step is...

## Attributes and Scores
Start your character with one point in each of your **Primary Attributes**, then add one point to the attribute of your choice.

You then must figure out your other scores (focus, speed, etc), referring back to the **Primary Attributes**.

## Choosing a Boon & Classes
When you're starting out, your character receives a **boon**, which is a special ability that helps them to be more effective. These boons are sorted into **classes** to help keep track of prerequisites, but do not feel locked into a class! Mixing and matching abilities to build a character that suits the story you are helping tell is more important.

## Leveling Up
After some progression in the story, your GM may decide that it is time for your characters to become stronger! You get to add another point to one of your [Primary Attributes](Player's%20Handbook.md#Primary%20Attributes), and if at an appropriate level you also receive another [boon](What%20is%20a%20Boon?.md)!

# Playing the Game
Most TTRPGs are broken down into a cycle of play, but this is by no means a one-size fits all solution. Generally, a GM will describe the environment, and the players respond with what their character does. The GM then goes back and forth with the players, narrating the results of their actions and having the players respond, until a scene comes to a natural close.

## Initiative (or Order of Combat)
When you begin playing, everybody rolls a dexterity check, including the GM. This order is written down, and is the order that combat will happen in, the first of the order going after the last. This can be re-rolled at the end of combat, or only when you pick up in another session, up to the discretion of the GM. This temporary ordering is referred to as **Initiative**.

## Combat
Struggle is a part of every story, and it may present itself in the form of combat. Your characters have specific strengths and weaknesses based on your primary attributes. When somebody announces that they are doing something combative enough to warrant a full fight, that person goes first, and play follows the pre-rolled initiative starting from them.

## Resting
Your characters cannot stay awake indefinitely, and will need to recover and heal their wounds. Characters will need to rest for a total of 8 hours, up to two of which can be sitting/lying down but conscious. If characters go 24 hours without resting, they gain a **point of exhaustion**. Resting removes all points of exhaustion.

## Exhaustion
This comes when a character has undergone such a heavy burden (being awake for too long, physical exertion, or sustaining too much damage). There are different degrees of exhaustion, and they correspond with how many **points of exhaustion** that you have. For each point of exhaustion you've accumulated:

- You recover one less stamina and focus at the start of your turns (to a minimum of zero).
- Your speed is reduced by one tile (to a minimum of zero).

Exhaustion is not removed by healing. Only resting does this.

## On a Turn
It's your time to shine! Your character starts their turn by recovering some of their **Stamina** points (up to their maximum) the amount you recover of each is equal to your **Constitution**. Additionally, all characters recover at least one **Focus**, up to their maximum.

Now you're ready to go! You can take any of the following actions for the cost of 1 stamina point:

- Moving a distance up to your speed
- Attacking with a weapon (you must be on an adjacent square to do so with a melee weapon, or the target must be within range for a ranged weapon)

You can also use a spell for the cost of one **Stamina** point, as well as the listed **focus** cost for the spell.

If you do not have enough stamina and/or focus to take an action, you cannot do it.

## Resistances/vulnerabilities
Some enemies or characters may be resistant or vulnerable to certain types of damage (see **Damage Types** in the [Introduction](#introduction). If something is vulnerable to a type of attack, count your successes with advantage. If something is resistant to the type of attack, count the successes with disadvantage.

## Fading
Once your character reaches 0 heart, their grip on mortality is weakening and could soon die. On the start of your turn when you're fading, you gain a point of exhaustion. If you end your turn with three points of exhaustion, your character dies.

If you take damage while fading, consider your heart to be negative. Healing must bring you back up above 0 for you to be no longer fading.
