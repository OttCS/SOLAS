# [Ranger](Player's%20Handbook/Classes/Ranger.md)
Master tacticians armed with a razor-sharp intellect, who navigate the battlefield with precision discerning vulnerabilities and exploiting weaknesses in their adversaries' defenses. Through strategic insight, Rangers emerge as cerebral assassins, excelling in the art of calculated strikes and unraveling the mysteries of both the natural world and their unsuspecting foes.

# Boons

## Primary Boons
These can be taken without any prerequisites, being introductions to the Ranger class.

### Hunter's Mark
When you reduce a creature's heart, you forge a bond based on your keen perception and mental acuity: it is marked. When you attack the marked creature, add additional damage based on the successes of a **Mind Check**, and the mark vanishes.

*The Hunter's Mark is a valuable piece of information gleaned by damaging an enemy, by seeing how your next shot could be even more deadly. With the vulnerabilities of the enemies exposed, you are able to unleash devastation against your marked adversary.*

### Rogue Agent
You have mastered the art of capitalizing on an enemy's moment of vulnerability. When you have advantage on an attack against a creature, you roll additional dice equal to your **Mind** score as part of the damage.

_The razor-sharp focus of your mind in the midst of battle discerns the precise moments to strike. With each attack, your mind guides your strikes with unparalleled precision, unraveling the vulnerabilities of your adversaries and delivering calculated blows that leave an indelible mark on the battlefield._

## Secondary Boons
You must have at least one of the **Ranger Primary Boons** to gain one of these.

### Blood Hunter
You've learned occult rituals that twist the ways of normal arcane to help you track down your targets. When you mark a creature, you lose R1 heart, with your blood sacrifice strengthening the bond between you. You choose an elemental or celestial damage type for the nature of the bond when you select this boon.

- **Binding Curse**. When you attack a marked creature, they must make a **Strength Check** against the damage they received. If they fail, their speed is reduced to 0 until the end of your next turn.
- **Crimson Brand**. If a marked creature is within melee range of you and attacks you or an ally, you can expend any number of **Focus** points you currently have. You roll a number of dice equal to the focus points you expended, the successes being damage to the creature of your mark's type.

_With a whispered incantation and the willing sacrifice of your life essence, the Blood Hunter's Pact is sealed. Each mark etched upon your enemies becomes a conduit for the eldritch forces within, turning your relentless pursuit into a dance of blood and magic. Through occult rituals and the strength of your indomitable will, you stand as a Blood Hunter, an otherworldly predator bound by a pact written in the language of primal forces._
