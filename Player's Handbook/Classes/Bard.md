# [Bard](Bard.md)
Nimble maestros of the arcane, weaving enchantments with finesse, their dexterous movements orchestrating spells that dance through the air like musical notes. Through a harmony of both magic and agility, they captivate their audience not only with melodious tunes but also with the dazzling spectacle of their deft spellcasting.

# Boons

## Primary Boons
These can be taken without any prerequisites, being introductions to the **Bard** class.

### Harmonic Echo
Your agile nature deepens, each part of your body coming together in unison. For a number of times equal to your mind score per rest, when you make a **dexterity check**, you can spend a focus point to add the successes of a **mind check**.

_As you deftly navigate the intricacies of your performance, the harmonious melding of dexterity and intellect allows you to transcend the realm of physical. A testament to your mastery, your movements exude fluid grace, your nimbleness elevated to a level where the mind and body dance in perfect unison._

### Inspiration
A number of times equal to your mind score, you can give the successes of **Dexterity Check** to a creature you can see, when they are making a roll (checks, attacks, spells, etc).

_Your honed talents help to bring out the best in others, especially in times of need. As your music (or other craft) washes over your ally, they are boosted to achieve more than they alone could._

## Secondary Boons
You must have at least one of the **Bard Primary Boons** to gain one of these.

### Versatile Performer
Your maximum focus becomes equal to your **Mind + Dexterity**, ensuring that your nimble movements and agility contribute the wellspring of arcane energy at your disposal. This does not increase the number of spells you can memorize

_In the fluidity of your performance, each deft motion becomes a reservoir for arcane potential. The finesse of your dexterity harmonizes with your arcane prowess, expanding the very boundaries of what you are capable of._
