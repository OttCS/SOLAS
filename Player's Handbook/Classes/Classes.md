Consider these "classes" as areas of expertise, in how your character interacts with the world. Each of the introductory boons for each class can be taken by anyone, and any number of boons from each "tier" can be taken. However, you must take at least one boon in all lower tiers to take a higher one.

These categories and classes are simply general indications of what the boons are like and what they rely on. Each main statistic features martial and caster options. Creativity is encouraged in this game, and here is no exception. Mix and match to your heart's content!
