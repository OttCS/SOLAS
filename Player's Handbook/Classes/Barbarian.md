# The [[Barbarian]]
Untamed warriors fueled by primal fury, embodying the raw essence of chaos and unrestrained power. Channeling their inner beasts, they unleash a torrent of unbridled rage, becoming living tempests on the battlefield, leaving destruction in their wake.

# Boons

## Primary Boons
These can be taken without any prerequisites, being introductions to the **Barbarian** class.

### Rage
On your turn, you can use **One Focus** to rage. While raging, you have advantage on all strength checks, but you do not recover spent focus. Your rage ends when you do not take damage in between two turns. Additionally, if you are not wearing armor, you can reduce incoming physical damage by one per attack (as if you were wearing light armor).

*Fueled by an inner fury, you can tap into the raw, untamed power coursing through you. As you enter a state of rage, your senses sharpen, and a ferocious determination takes hold. Stripped of armor, you become a living tempest, deflecting incoming attacks with sheer might.*

### Swift Strike
When you make a melee attack, you can expend a focus point to improve the accuracy of the strike. You can add the successes of a **dexterity check** to the damage.

*In the midst of combat, you let your mind synchronize with the rhythm of the battle around you, your weapon becoming an extension of your nimble prowess. With an agile finesse that transcends the mundane, you weave through the chaos, striking with unparalleled precision. Each successful attack not only lands with devastating force but also bears the mark of your tactical brilliance, the keen edge of your mind adding an extra layer of potency to the damage wrought upon your foes.*

## Secondary Boons
You must have at least one of the **Barbarian Primary Boons** to gain one of these.

### Might of the Berserker
While raging: Your advantage on all strength checks now encompasses your physical melee attacks, and your damage reduction is increased to two (as if you were wearing medium armor). Furthermore, you can now spend a focus point in response to taking any damage, reducing the incoming attack by the successes of a **Strength Check**.

*Through pushing your rage to new levels, you can now unleash a more chaotic, unpredictable anger on your foes. While in this enhanced state, your tolerance reaches new thresholds, and your attacks carve through your enemies indiscriminately.*

### Unyielding Resilience
Forged in the crucible of unwavering strength and indomitable spirit, you can tap into Unyielding Resilience, melding physical might with an unbreakable resolve. A number of times equal to your **Constitution** per rest, you can gain a number of hit points equal to the successes of a **Strength check**, even going above your normal maximum.

*You become the manifestation of primal fortitude allows you to weather the storm of battle with sheer tenacity. Your physical fortitude seems to extend when you need it most, transforming you into an immovable bulwark, ready to withstand the harshest of trials on the battlefield.*
