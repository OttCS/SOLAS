SOLAS is a simply organized, lightweight adventure system that takes the good aspects of many TTRPGs and condenses it into an understandable and easy-to-learn system that lets you tell any story.

The main goals of TTRPGs are to provide exploration, social interaction, and combat, but many have far too complex systems that don't allow new players to pick up the rulebook and start playing that same day.

Solas's goal is to make a dead-simple system that uses players' knowledge of storytelling to allow them to quickly understand their options and get started playing with any type of story they want to tell, in any setting. Whether it's Cowboys vs Aliens, a Murder Mystery, or Medieval Fantasy, Solas helps you tell that story in a fun, interactive way.

For players, just reading the [[Core Rules]] should allow you to create your character sheet and start playing!

For Game Masters (GMs), it's advisable that you read both the [[Core Rules]] and the [[Adventure Build Guide]].
