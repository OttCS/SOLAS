# Preface
SOLAS is a simply organized, lightweight adventure system that takes the good aspects of many TTRPGs and condenses it into an understandable and easy-to-learn system that lets you tell any story.

The main goals of TTRPGs are to provide exploration, social interaction, and combat, but many have far too complex systems that don't allow new players to pick up the rulebook and start playing that same day.

Solas's goal is to make a dead-simple system that uses players' knowledge of storytelling to allow them to quickly understand their options and get started playing with any type of story they want to tell, in any setting. Whether it's cowboys vs aliens, a prohibition murder mystery, or medieval fantasy, Solas helps you tell that story in a fun, interactive way.

# Welcome to SOLAS
SOLAS is a system for running tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) that anybody can pick up and play. TTRPGs are about getting together with others and letting a story play out, with players controlling characters of their design.

To play, you'll need more than two people (one of whom is the Game Master), a way to take notes, and at least one standard six-sided die. Other materials are nice to have (like more d6s), but are certainly not needed.

# Terms
This guide uses certain words to describe different aspects of the game, which are defined below:
- **Tile**: Typically a square or hexagon on a grid, consider this to be 3ft or 1m
- **Trick**: Something that a character is able to do which isn't an aspect of their normal self. This works for lots of settings, from flashbangs to spells to traps

# Primary Attributes
Characters in the game have different categories to describe their areas of expertise. The number associated with each attribute is its relative effectiveness, 1 being the minimum possible, and 7 being the maximum possible. The categories are as follows:

**Strength** *Natural athleticism, physical power*
- Effectiveness with melee weapons
- Resistance

**Dexterity** *Physical agility, reflexes, precision*
- Effectiveness with ranged weapons
- Speed

**Constitution** *Physical/Mental toughness, persistance*
- Health
- Stamina

**Mind** *Analytical skill, intuition*
- Tricks
- Focus

## Resistance
How much of a hit you can take before it harms you. These points are used up when you get damaged by something, and some are given back at the start of each turn. The upper limit is your **Constitution** score, and the regeneration is equal to your character's level.

## Stamina
This is your physical ablness at any given moment. These points are used up when you move or attack, and some are given back at the start of each turn. The upper limit of this is your **Constitution** score, and the regeneration is equal to your character's level.

## Focus
Is your mental concentration at any given moment. These points are used up when you use tricks, and some are given back at the start of each turn. The upper limit of this is your **Mind** score, and the regeneration is equal to your character's level.

## Speed
How fast your character is able to move during a turn. This is a number of tiles equal to 3 plus your **Dexterity** score.

# Mechanics
SOLAS is inspired by old TTRPG systems like Dungeons and Dragons and FATE, as well as some more obscure tabletop games like T.I.M.E. stories and the Hollow Knight TTRPG. As such, some mechanics will be familiar to veterens of tabletop games. Previous experience is not required, and SOLAS is designed to be as understandable for new players as possible.

## Rolling
A die roll is when someone rolls a standard six-sided die to determine an outcome. Typically, a roll of 4 or higher is a success, and lower is a failure. Sometimes a roll is specified as "advantaged" (indicated by an A) which means dice rolls succeed on a 3 or higher. Another variant is "disadvantaged" (indicated by a D), which means dice rolls succeed on a 5 or higher. A 6 is always considered to be 2 successes.

## Checks
The GM decides which primary attribute is used for any checks, which determines the number of dice you roll. For example, a strength check with a player who has a 3 strength would roll 3d6.

# Combat
Struggle is a part of every story, and it may present itself in the form of combat. Your characters have specific strengths and weaknesses based on your primary attributes.

## Melee Attacks
Your character can use any melee weapon to attack something/someone within one tile. This calls for a **Strength** roll, plus any additional modifiers provided by the weapon or passive bonuses you may have. Count the total number of successes you rolled, and remove this amount from their current resistance. If you would remove more than they have remaining, the excess is direct damage to their health.

## Ranged Attacks
Similar to **melee attacks**, but instead this calls for a **Dexterity** roll. The distance you can attack over is provided by the weapon or passive bonuses that you may have.

## Tricks
Tricks have varied costs, associated with their mental difficulty, as well as varying ranges they can be used over. Please refer to the [Tricks](Tricks.md) documentation.

## On Your Turn
On your turn, you may use any number of stamina or focus points, by taking any of the following actions that you are permitted to use:
- **Movement**: Uses 1 point per tile
- **Attacks**: Uses 1 point per
- **Tricks**: Point usage depends on the difficulty of the trick
