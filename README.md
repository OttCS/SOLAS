# Preface
SOLAS is a simply organized, lightweight adventure system that takes the good aspects of many TTRPGs and condenses it into an understandable and easy-to-learn system that lets you tell any story.

The main goals of TTRPGs are to provide exploration, social interaction, and combat, but many have far too complex systems that don't allow new players to pick up the rulebook and start playing that same day.

Solas's goal is to make a dead-simple system that uses players' knowledge of storytelling to allow them to quickly understand their options and get started playing with any type of story they want to tell, in any setting. Whether it's cowboys vs aliens, a prohibition murder mystery, or medieval fantasy, Solas helps you tell that story in a fun, interactive way.

# Welcome to SOLAS
SOLAS is a system for running tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) that anybody can pick up and play. TTRPGs are about getting together with others and letting a story play out, with players controlling characters of their design.

To play, you'll need more than two people (one of whom is the Game Master), a way to take notes, and at least one standard six-sided die. Other materials are nice to have, but are certainly not needed.

# Mechanics
SOLAS is inspired by old TTRPG systems like Dungeons and Dragons and FATE, as well as some more obscure tabletop games like T.I.M.E. stories. As such, some mechanics will be familiar to veterens of tabletop games. Previous experience is not required, and SOLAS is designed to be as understandable for new players as possible.

## Solace
**3 + Charisma**

Comfort in sorrow, misfortune, or distress, solace allows you to fudge your way to success, or even to cheat death. Every character has a pool of points called solace that can be used to succeed or reduce pitfalls, but at a potential cost. When you reach zero points of solace, you do not get any back until your next rest. Solace can be used after rolls, but always before outcomes are determined.

**Reducing Damage**. When you take damage, you can spend a point of solace to reduce it. Roll a die, and reduce the damage taken by the amount shown. This can be done multiple times for each instance you take damage, provided you have enough points of solace to do so.

**Increasing Rolls**. Whenever you roll at least one die, you can spend a point of solace to improve it. Roll a die, and increase the original result by the amount shown. This can be done multiple times for each attack or check you make, provided you have enough points of solace to do so.

## Attacking
**Weapon Dice + Ability**

Making an attack against something is an effort to do lasting harm to it. Your type of weapon determines the damage dice you can use, and the ability associated with it is what you add to the attack total.

|Type|Category|Stat|Damage|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Melee**|Power|Str|1d6||
||Great Power|Str|2d6, use highest|Two-Handed|
||Precision Melee|Dex|1d6||
|**Ranged**|Power|Str|1d6|R60|
||Precision|Dex|1d6|R30|
||Heavy Precision|Dex|2d6, use highest|R60, Two-Handed|

## Defense
**4 + Dexterity + Constitution**

This is a measure of how much of a hit you can take before lasting damage is done. It is based on your dexterity and your constitution, thought of as "how much you can dodge" and "how much you can shrug off."

When you are attacked, compare the total attack to your defense. If your defense is the same or higher, you don't take any damage! If your defense is lower however, you take damage equal to the difference (5 attack vs 3 defense does 2 damage).

## Hit Points
**5 + Level + Constitution**

This is a measure of how much damage your body can take before quitting. When you reach zero, you aren't immediately dead. See the mechanics section on **fading**.

## Fading
When your character dips below 1 hit point, they begin fading. This can be flavored as bleeding out, vision going black, etc. Once they are below -6 hit points, they are truly dead. When it is your turn, you lose a hit point automatically. If you wish to do anything but stay/go prone (laying down on the ground), you may expend an extra hit point and be able to perform actions, take movement, etc. on that turn.

# Characters
This is how the players interact with the world of the GM's creation. Characters are designed by their respective players and have abilities, backgrounds, weapons, tools, and boons, all to help each player target their ideal play style.

## Concept
The character concept is arguably the most important aspect of a character, which depends on the setting of the game. A charming sleuth capable of getting information from witnesses? A satyr druid, whose jolly demeanor quickly shifts at the harming of animals? Let your imagination run wild!

***Choosing***. While coming up with a character concept is an excercise in creativity, consider the not-often used [Jungian Archetypes](https://conorneill.com/2018/04/21/understanding-personality-the-12-jungian-archetypes/). These provide interesting bases for character archetypes, and when being fit into different settings lend themselves to different backgrounds, professions, and worldviews.

## Abilities
Your character will have both strengths and weaknesses, as no one can be perfect for every situation. Abilities are a collection of six areas of expertise, that characters all have differing scores in.

|Stat|Strength|Dexterity|Constitution|Intelligence|Wisdom|Charisma|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Keyword**|Power|Precision|Persist|Puzzle|Practice|Presence|
|**Description**|Natural athleticism|Physical agility, reflexes|Physical/Mental toughness|Analytical skill|Awareness, intuition|Confidence, eloquence|

Each ability score will be a number, from -3 to +6. This is what will be added when using that particular skill, whether for a strength attack or an intelligence roll.

***Choosing***. To choose your character's ability scores, start each at a -3. Keeping your character's personality and physicality in mind, as well as how they handle challenges, distribute 12 total to each of the scores, with a maximum of +1.

***For Later Levels***. Upon leveling up, you can add two total points to your ability scores. Note that no score can be above your new level, and no scores can go higher than +6.

# Adventures
Now it's time to embark on your adventure! The GM begins by introducing the world, and describes the scene you currently find yourselves in. At that point, it's up to the **characters** how they interact with the world around them by talking to people, poking around, etc. Try to act in character, describing what *you* do rather than what your character does.

Your character can do almost anything when interacting with the world, whether in or out of combat. Weapons can be typically used to damage things and people, tools can be used to interact with other things, and tricks are things that are typically magical, supernatural, or just generally not found in our world.

## Checks
In the event that a character attempts something that isn't a given (i.e. some difficulty or skill associated with it), the GM can ask for a check of a particular stat. This could be a strength check for moving a bookshelf, a dexterity check to see how you pilot a ship, an intelligence check to see if you can understand an ancient artifact, a charisma check to see if you can convince someone of a lie, you get the picture.

To roll a check, the GM determines the type (strength, wisdom, etc.) and sets the difficulty. You then roll a die and add your modifier, and you or the GM describe how you pass or fail.

## Exploration
Checking out ancient tombs, unmapped planets, an old house said to be haunted, all are examples of exploration. While the **characters** choose where they want to go, it is ultimately up to the GM to decide what are in these places.

## Social Interaction
Talking to a shopkeeper, coming up with an infiltration plan between characters, or trying to weasle your way out of consequences are all social interaction. It's up to the **characters** what they say, and up to the GM how it plays out.

## Combat
Combat is a common thing in plenty of stories, and can be a great thematic moment for character and story development.

***Initiative***. Everybody (including the GM) rolls 2d6. The player who rolled highest goes first, play continues to the right (including the GM).

***On Your Turn***. There are three options that can be taken on your turn in combat: 1 movement, 1 action, and 1 bonus action.

|Name|Description|Category|
|-|-|-|
|Go Prone|You lay down|Movement/Action|
|Stand Up|From prone, you stand up|Movement/Action|
|Run|You move up to 6 spaces|Movement/Action|
|Hide|You attempt to conceal yourself|Movement/Action|
|Attack|You use a weapon to deal damage|Action|
|Shove|You attempt to knock a creature prone|Action|
|Use|You use an item|Action|
|Quick Use|You can use an item specified as "quick"|Bonus Action|
