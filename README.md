# Preface
The main goals of TTRPGs are to provide exploration, social interaction, and combat, but many have far too complex systems that don't allow new players to pick up the rulebook and start playing that same day.

Solas's goal is to make a dead-simple system that uses players' knowledge of storytelling to allow them to quickly understand their options and get started playing with any type of story they want to tell, in any setting. Whether it's cowboys vs aliens, a prohibition murder mystery, or medieval fantasy, Solas helps you tell that story in a fun, interactive way.

I grew up playing first edition Dungeons and Dragons (copyright, Hasbro), and when I moved to fifth edition I noticed some things that didn't seem like they helped streamline the TTRPG process. Spell lists had been made confusing, with differing rules for different classes and combat having more moving pieces but less flexibility. After playing TIME Stories (copyright, Space Cowboys) and seeing the strengths of a D6 dice system, I starting building out this system. After getting wind of a fan-made Hollow Knight-inspired TTRPG, I started refining the mechanics of SOLAS.

And that's where we are today! Thanks for checking it out

# Welcome to SOLAS
SOLAS is a system for running tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) that anybody can pick up and play. TTRPGs are about getting together with others and letting a story play out, with players controlling characters of their design.

To play, you'll need more than two people (one of whom is the Game Master), a way to take notes, and at least one standard six-sided die. Other materials are nice to have (like more d6s), but are certainly not needed.

# Terms
This guide uses certain words to describe different aspects of the game, which are defined below:
- **R(*Followed by a number*)**: Indicates how many six-sided dice you roll
- **Tile**: Typically a square or hexagon on a grid, consider this to be 3ft or 1m
- **Trick**: Something that a character is able to do which isn't an aspect of their normal self. This works for lots of settings, from flashbangs to spells to traps

# Primary Attributes
Characters in the game have different categories to describe their areas of expertise. The number associated with each attribute is its relative effectiveness, 1 being the minimum possible. The categories are as follows:

**Strength** *Natural athleticism, physical power*
- Effectiveness with melee weapons
- Armor limit

**Dexterity** *Physical agility, reflexes, precision*
- Effectiveness with ranged weapons
- Speed

**Mind** *Analytical skill, intuition*
- Tricks
- Focus

**Constitution** *Physical/Mental toughness, persistance*
- Heart
- Resistance/Stamina/Focus

## Resistance
How much of a hit you can take before it harms you. These points are used up when you get damaged by something, and some are given back at the start of each turn. The upper limit is your **Strength** score plus any armor you are wearing, and the regeneration is equal to your **Constitution**. Your resistance is brought back up to full after combat ends.

## Speed
How fast your character is able to move during a turn. This is a number of tiles equal to 4 plus your **Dexterity** score.

## Heart
How much of a beating your character can take, and once it reaches zero you begin fading. This number is equal to your **Constitution** plus your character's level, and is brought back up to full after resting.

## Stamina
This is your physical ablness at any given moment. These points are used up when you move or attack, and some are given back at the start of each turn. The upper limit of this is 3, and the regeneration is equal to your **Constitution** score. Your stamina is brought back up to full after combat ends.

## Focus
Is your mental concentration at any given moment. These points are used up when you use tricks, and some are given back at the start of each turn. The upper limit of this is your **Mind** score, and the regeneration is equal to your **Constitution**. Your focus is brought back up to full after combat ends.

# Mechanics
SOLAS is inspired by old TTRPG systems like Dungeons and Dragons and FATE, as well as some more obscure tabletop games like T.I.M.E. stories and the fan-made Hollow Knight RPG. As such, some mechanics will be familiar to veterens of tabletop games. Previous experience is not required, and SOLAS is designed to be as understandable for new players as possible.

## Rolling
A die roll (R#) is when someone rolls at least one standard six-sided die to determine an outcome. Typically, a roll of 4 or higher is a success, and lower is a failure. Sometimes a roll is specified as "advantaged" (indicated by an A) which means dice rolls succeed on a 3 or higher. Another variant is "disadvantaged" (indicated by a D), which means dice rolls succeed on a 5 or higher. Rolling a 6 is always considered to be 2 successes. Advantages and disadvantages both stack, and each cancels another out. 2 advantages means the dice are successes on 2 or higher. For easy reference:
|AAA|AA|A|-|D|DD|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Any number|2+|3+|4+|5+|6 exclusively|

## Checks
The GM decides which primary attribute is used for any checks, which determines the number of dice you roll. For example, a strength check with a player who has a 3 strength would get to roll R3.

## Damage Types
SOLAS contains many different damage types for different weapons and tricks. This list can be expanded upon for your needs, but the basic list is as follows:
**Physical**: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing
**Elemental**: Acid, Fire, Cold, Lightning
**Celestial**: Radiant, Necrotic, Force, Psychic

# Combat
Struggle is a part of every story, and it may present itself in the form of combat. Your characters have specific strengths and weaknesses based on your primary attributes.

## Melee Attacks
Your character can use any melee weapon to attack something/someone within one tile. This calls for a **Strength** roll, plus any additional modifiers provided by the weapon or passive bonuses you may have. Count the total number of successes you rolled, and remove this amount from their current resistance. If you would remove more than they have remaining, the excess is direct damage to their remaining heart.

## Ranged Attacks
Similar to **melee attacks**, but instead this calls for a **Dexterity** roll. The distance you can attack over is provided by the weapon or passive bonuses that you may have.

## Tricks
Tricks have varied costs, associated with their mental difficulty, as well as varying ranges they can be used over. Please refer to the [Tricks](Tricks.md) documentation.

## Resistances/Weaknesses
Some enemies or characters may be resistant or weak to certain types of damage. If something is weak to a type of attack, count your successes with advantage. If something is resistant to the type of attack, count the successes with disadvantage.

## Fading
Once your character reaches 0 heart, you begin fading. This means your character is losing their grip on mortality, and will soon die. Once you reach 0 heart, continuing to fight is dangerous. At the start of each of your turns, you lose a heart. Additionally, you can choose to lose an extra heart to take your normal turn, being any number of actions up to your current stamina/focus. Once you reach -5 heart, your character falls and passes.

# On Your Turn
You regenerate some of your stamina, focus, and resistance. You may use any number of your remaining stamina or focus points, by taking any of the following actions that you are permitted to use:
- **Movement**: Use 1 **Stamina** point to move up to your speed
- **Attacks**: Uses 1 **Stamina** point per attack
- **Tricks**: Uses 1 **Stamina** point per trick, as well as **Focus** points based on trick difficulty
