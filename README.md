SOLAS is a system for running tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) that anybody can pick up and play. TTRPGs are about getting together with others and letting a story play out, with players controlling characters of their design.

To play, you'll need more than two people (one of whom is the Game Master, referred to as the GM), a way to take notes, and at least one standard six-sided die. Other materials are nice to have (like more d6s), but are certainly not needed.

# Terms
This guide uses certain words to describe different aspects of the game, which are defined below:

## Rolling
A die roll is when someone rolls at least one standard six-sided die to determine an outcome. Typically, a roll of 4 or higher is a success, and lower is a failure.
-  These are indicated by **R**, followed by a number such as R1, R4, etc.

Sometimes a roll is specified as "advantaged" (indicated by an A) which means dice rolls succeed on a 3 or higher. Another variant is "disadvantaged" (indicated by a D), which means dice rolls succeed on a 5 or higher. Rolling a 6 is always considered to be 2 successes. Advantages and disadvantages both stack, and each cancels another out. 2 advantages means the dice are successes on 2 or higher. For easy reference:

|AAA|AA|A|-|D|DD|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Any number|2+|3+|4+|5+|6 exclusively|

Rolls can be used to determine damage, healing, or checks of your abilities. The weapon, trick, or GM will describe what you are trying to accomplish and what attribute you will be using. If your GM calls for a Dexterity roll (perhaps you've activated a trap!), you would roll a number of dice equal to your dexterity score, and count your successes.

## Tricks
Something that a character is able to do which isn't an aspect of their normal self. This works for lots of settings, from flashbangs to spells to traps

## Tiles
A tile is typically a square or hexagon on a grid, and is considered to be 5 feet (or 1.5 meters). While you may not be playing with an actual grid at all, this still describes specific distances for tricks, ranges, and movement.

# Primary Attributes
Characters in the game have different categories to describe their areas of expertise. The number associated with each attribute is its relative effectiveness, 1 being the minimum possible. The categories are as follows:

## Strength
*Natural athleticism, physical power*
- Effectiveness with [melee weapons](Weapons.md)
- What [armor](Armor.md) you can wear

## Dexterity
*Physical agility, reflexes, precision*
- **Speed**: How fast your character is, 4 tiles plus **dexterity**
- Effectiveness with [ranged weapons](Weapons.md)

## Mind
*Analytical skill, intuition*
- [Tricks](tricks.md)
- **Focus**: Your mental concentration on a trick. Your **Mind** is the maximum

## Constitution
*Physical/Mental toughness, persistance*
- **Heart**: How much character can take before falling, **Constitution** times Level, plus 5
- **Recovery**: How rapidly you can physically/mentally recover from exertion. At the start of your turn, your **Constitution** gets added back to your amounts of **Focus** and **Stamina**.

# Point Pools
These are points you can save up to spend attacking, moving, or doing tricks. When combat ends, these are returned to their maximum.

## Focus
Is your mental concentration at any given moment. These points are used up when you use tricks, and some are given back at the start of each turn.
- The upper limit of this is your **Mind** score.

## Stamina
This is your physical ablness at any given moment. These points are used up when you move or attack, and some are given back at the start of each turn.
- The standard limit of this is 3.

# Combat
Struggle is a part of every story, and it may present itself in the form of combat. Your characters have specific strengths and weaknesses based on your primary attributes. To start combat, everybody (including the GM) makes a dexterity check, where play goes highest to lowest according to the number of successes.

## On Your Turn
- Recover some stamina and focus
- Use any number of your remaining stamina or focus points, by taking any of the following actions:

| |Movement|Attack|Trick|
|-|-|-|-|
|*Cost*|1 Stamina|1 Stamina|1 Stamina + Focus Cost|
|*Result*|Move up to your **speed**|See [Weapons](Weapons.md)|See [Tricks](Tricks.md)|

## Damage Types
SOLAS contains many different damage types for different weapons and tricks. This list can be expanded upon for your needs, but the standard categories as follows:
- **Physical**: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing
- **Elemental**: Acid, Fire, Cold, Lightning
- **Celestial**: Radiant, Necrotic, Force, Psychic

## Resistances/Weaknesses
Some enemies or characters may be resistant or weak to certain types of damage. If something is weak to a type of attack, count your successes with advantage. If something is resistant to the type of attack, count the successes with disadvantage.

## Fading
Once your character reaches 0 heart, you begin fading. This means your character is losing their grip on mortality, and will soon die. Once you reach 0 heart, continuing to fight is dangerous. At the start of each of your turns, you lose a heart. Additionally, you can choose to lose an extra heart to take your normal turn, being any number of actions up to your current stamina/focus. Once you reach -5 heart, your character falls and passes.
