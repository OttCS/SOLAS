# Preface
The main goals of TTRPGs are to provide exploration, social interaction, and combat, but many have far too complex systems that don't allow new players to pick up the rulebook and start playing that same day.

Solas's goal is to make a dead-simple system that uses players' knowledge of storytelling to allow them to quickly understand their options and get started playing with any type of story they want to tell, in any setting. Whether it's cowboys vs aliens, a prohibition murder mystery, or medieval fantasy, Solas helps you tell that story in a fun, interactive way.

I grew up playing first edition Dungeons and Dragons (copyright, Hasbro), and when I moved to fifth edition I noticed some things that didn't seem like they helped streamline the TTRPG process. Spell lists had been made confusing, with differing rules for different classes and combat having more moving pieces but less flexibility. After playing TIME Stories (copyright, Space Cowboys) and seeing the strengths of a D6 dice system, I starting building out this system. After getting wind of a fan-made Hollow Knight-inspired TTRPG, and playing a hybrid first/fifth edition Dungeons with friends, I started refining the mechanics of SOLAS to make it an easily adaptible and quicker to learn, and more usable for different settings.

And that's where we are today! Thanks for checking it out.

# Introduction
Welcome to SOLAS! It's a rules system for running tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) that anybody can pick up and play. TTRPGs are about getting together with others and letting a story play out, with players controlling characters of their own creation.

To play, you'll need more than two people (one of whom is the Game Master, referred to as the GM), a way to take notes, and at least one standard six-sided die. Other materials are nice to have (like more d6s, some way to take notes), but are certainly not needed.

## Rolling
A die roll is when someone rolls at least one standard six-sided die to determine an outcome. A roll of four or higher is a success (a six is worth two successes), meaning a three or lower is a failure. The “result” of a roll is how many total successes there are. In these rules, rolls are indicated in these rules by an **R**, followed by a number such as R1, R4, etc. The **R** indicates a roll, and the number after it is the number of dice that you are rolling.

Sometimes a roll is specified as “advantaged” which means dice rolls succeed on a 3 or higher. Another variant is “disadvantaged” which means dice rolls succeed on a 5 or higher. Rolling a 6 is always considered to be 2 successes. Advantages and disadvantages don't stack, you can only be "advantaged" or "disadvantaged" and any amount of each cancels out.

Rolls can be used to determine damage, healing, or checks of your abilities. The weapon, spell, or GM will describe what you are trying to accomplish and what attribute you will be using.

## Checks
A check is when you rely on a particular skill to determine an outcome. If your GM calls for a Dexterity Check (perhaps you've activated a trap!), you would roll a number of dice equal to your dexterity score, and count your successes. If you meet or exceed the difficulty of the check, you succeed!

Checks can also be **contested**. This is where a character attempts a roll against someone else's score. If the character gets more successes that the score they're against, they succeed! These checks will be written as **Attribute Check vs Attribute**.

## Damage Types
SOLAS contains many different damage types for different weapons and spells. This list can be expanded upon for your needs, but the standard categories as follows:

- **Physical**: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing
- **Elemental**: Acid, Poison, Fire, Cold, Lightning
- **Celestial**: Radiant, Necrotic, Force, Psychic

## Point Pools
These are points you can save up to spend attacking, moving, or doing spells. When combat ends, these are returned to their maximum.

**Focus** is your mental concentration at any given moment. These points are used up when you use spells and certain abilities, and some are given back at the start of each turn.

**Stamina** is your physical ableness at any given moment. These points are used up when you move or attack, and some are given back at the start of each turn. Every character has 3 stamina points.

## Primary Attributes
Characters in the game have different attributes to describe their general skills. The number associated with each attribute is its relative effectiveness, 1 being the minimum possible. The categories are as follows:

**Strength** *Natural athleticism, physical power*

**Dexterity** *Physical agility, reflexes, precision*

**Constitution** *Physical/Mental toughness, persistance*

**Mind** *Analytical skill, intuition*

## Tiles
A tile is typically a square or hexagon on a grid, and is considered to be 5 feet (or 1.5 meters). While you may not be playing with an actual grid at all, this still describes specific distances for spells, ranges, and movement.
