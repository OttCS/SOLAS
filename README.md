# Preface
SOLAS is a simply organized, lightweight adventure system that takes the good aspects of many TTRPGs and condenses it into an understandable and easy-to-learn system that lets you tell any story.

The main goals of TTRPGs are to provide exploration, social interaction, and combat, but many have far too complex systems that don't allow new players to pick up the rulebook and start playing that same day.

Solas's goal is to make a dead-simple system that uses players' knowledge of storytelling to allow them to quickly understand their options and get started playing with any type of story they want to tell, in any setting. Whether it's cowboys vs aliens, a prohibition murder mystery, or medieval fantasy, Solas helps you tell that story in a fun, interactive way.

# Welcome to SOLAS
SOLAS is a system for running tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) that anybody can pick up and play. TTRPGs are about getting together with others and letting a story play out, with players controlling characters of their design.

To play, you'll need (typically) more than two people, a way to take notes, and at least one six-sided die. Other materials are nice to have, but are certainly not needed.

One player takes the role of the Game Master (GM), who describes scenes and situations for players to react with their character actions. The other players include

Characters are designed by individual players, and include abilities, background, weapons, tools, etc.

# Characters
This is how the players interact with the world of the GM's creation. Characters are designed by their respective players and have abilities, backgrounds, weapons, tools, and boons, all to help each player target their ideal play style.

## Concept
The character concept is arguably the most important aspect of a character, which depends on the setting of the game. A charming sleuth capable of getting information from witnesses? A satyr druid, whose jolly demeanor quickly shifts at the harming of animals? Let your imagination run wild!

***Choosing***. While coming up with a character concept is an excercise in creativity, consider the not-often used [Jungian Archetypes](https://conorneill.com/2018/04/21/understanding-personality-the-12-jungian-archetypes/). These provide interesting bases for character archetypes, and when being fit into different settings lend themselves to different backgrounds, professions, and worldviews.

## Abilities
Your character will have both strengths and weaknesses, as no one can be perfect for every situation. Abilities are a collection of six areas of expertise, that characters all have differing scores in.

|Stat|Strength|Dexterity|Constitution|Intelligence|Wisdom|Charisma|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Keyword**|Power|Precision|Persist|Puzzle|Practice|Presence|
|**Description**|Natural athleticism|Physical agility, reflexes|Physical/Mental toughness|Analytical skill|Awareness, intuition|Confidence, eloquence|

Each ability score will be a number, from -3 to +6. This is what will be added when using that particular skill, whether for a strength attack or an intelligence roll.

***Choosing***. To choose your character's ability scores, start each at a -3. Keeping your character's personality and physicality in mind, as well as how they handle challenges, distribute 12 total to each of the scores, with a maximum of +1.

***For Later Levels***. Upon leveling up, you can add another point to an ability score.

## Boons
Abilities determine the general aptitudes of characters, but boons determine specific mechanical advantages they have over situations and enemies.
