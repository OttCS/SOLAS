# Preface
The main goals of TTRPGs are to provide exploration, social interaction, and combat for a group with a common interest in storytelling. Unfortunately, a lot have really complex systems that stop new players from picking up the rules and start playing that same day.

The goal of SOLAS is to do that. A dead-simple system that uses players' knowledge of storytelling to allow them to quickly understand their options and get started playing with any type of story they want to tell. While most of SOLAS is flavored as Medieval fantasy with a dose of Lovecraft, it has the flexibility to accommodate many other settings, have fun with it and let me know if you cook up something crazy!

I grew up playing first edition Dungeons and Dragons (copyright, WotC and Hasbro), and when I moved to fifth edition I noticed some things that didn't seem like they helped streamline the TTRPG process. Spell lists had been made confusing, with differing rules for different classes and combat having more moving pieces yet less flexibility. After playing TIME Stories (copyright, Space Cowboys) and seeing the strengths of a D6 dice system, I starting building out this system. Call of Cthulu, homebrewed DnD with friends, and a fan-made Hollow Knight-inspired TTRPG, all helped inform the SOLAS mechanics to make it more adaptable, and quicker to learn for newcomers.

And that's where we are today! Thanks for checking it out.

# Thanks
Thanks to all of my friends who I shoveled this system onto, just to rules a couple months later. Sorry for the headaches, but hopefully the fun stories outweighed them.

Huge thanks to Obsidian for the amazing piece of software, this would be impossible to create and maintain without it (SOLAS is not associated with Obsidian in any capacity).
