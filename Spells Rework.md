## Guiding Bolt

## Ray of Frost

### Witch Bolt
- **Concentration**
- Range: 6 Tiles
- Damage: R2 Lightning
- Effect: A beam of crackling energy lances out towards a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. If the target's heart is reduced, the arc stays connected. On each of your following turns until you lose **concentration** or the target leaves range, you can spend focus points again to deal damage to the creature with no stamina cost.
