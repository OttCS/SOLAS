# Problems with D&D 5e
*Because it's sticking around*

I love D&D 5e, there are just some issues that make the game tougher for new players to get invested in. This is just a list of all of the things that I have issues with, and how they could be resolved.

***Complicated Rolling System***. Roll a d20, add your modifiers, add magic weapon modifiers, maybe add your proficiency if you are proficient, and that determines if you hit/succeed. Then for attacks roll a different damage die, add sometimes a different set of modifiers (and subclass features), apply resistances/weaknesses. **Yikes**. The combat system alone takes a while to understand and that's only rolling. Understanding movement, strategic placement, cover rules, it's all so much for a beginner.
***Fix***. Use a single roll system. D6s are good because everybady has them. Modifiers are okay because it's not too hard to understand the purpose of them. Use AC as a damage subtraction system.
Roll damage dice -> Add stat modifier -> Compare to the defense -> Under fails, Over does the amount of damage above the defense

***Bad Death System***. Yeah rolling a nat 20 is cool but otherwise you're kinda there just waiting to spend 5 seconds on your turn rolling and then your turn is over.
***Fix***. Fading system, drama is had where characters are fighting to their last breath or trying to get out of harm's way. Reaching 0 is fading, and reaching -6 is truly dead. On each of your turns, you lose one hit point automatically. Doing anything besides going prone and ending your turn costs an extra hit point.

***D20 is has too much control for modifiers***. A player who is obnoxiously clumsy  (-2 dex) in heavy armor (disadvantage) can still roll up to a 17 (exclude nat 20s which auto-succeed) on stealth checks.
***Fix***. Lower core die, d6 would work, having a point swing of 5, which is as much as the normal d&d stat mods. Having a DC 1-10 system could make both the die *and* the modifier matter just as much. And realistically, an expert at a task having bad luck should be somewhat comparable to someone with no skill getting super lucky.

***Classes***. Honestly these are great for inspiration but they can lock players into a play style they didn't expect, which is especially troubling for longer campaigns.
***Fix***. Let players choose feats, boons, etc. within a set of premade rules to create a character with a set of skills they designed.

***Prone***. Not enough of a punishment.
***Fix***. Should be all movement on a turn
