  <h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
  <p>The main goals of TTRPGs are to provide exploration, social
    interaction, and combat, but many have far too complex systems that
    don’t allow new players to pick up the rulebook and start playing that
    same day.</p>
  <p>Solas’s goal is to make a dead-simple system that uses players’
    knowledge of storytelling to allow them to quickly understand their
    options and get started playing with any type of story they want to
    tell, in any setting. Whether it’s cowboys vs aliens, a prohibition
    murder mystery, or medieval fantasy, Solas helps you tell that story in
    a fun, interactive way.</p>
  <p>I grew up playing first edition Dungeons and Dragons (copyright,
    Hasbro), and when I moved to fifth edition I noticed some things that
    didn’t seem like they helped streamline the TTRPG process. Spell lists
    had been made confusing, with differing rules for different classes and
    combat having more moving pieces but less flexibility. After playing
    TIME Stories (copyright, Space Cowboys) and seeing the strengths of a D6
    dice system, I starting building out this system. After getting wind of
    a fan-made Hollow Knight-inspired TTRPG, and playing a hybrid
    first/fifth edition Dungeons with friends, I started refining the
    mechanics of SOLAS to make it an easily adaptible and quicker to
    learn.</p>
  <p>And that’s where we are today! Thanks for checking it out.</p>
  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
  <p>Welcome to SOLAS! It’s a rules system for running tabletop
    role-playing games (TTRPGs) that anybody can pick up and play. TTRPGs
    are about getting together with others and letting a story play out,
    with players controlling characters of their own creation.</p>
  <p>To play, you’ll need more than two people (one of whom is the Game
    Master, referred to as the GM), a way to take notes, and at least one
    standard six-sided die. Other materials are nice to have (like more d6s,
    some way to take notes), but are certainly not needed.</p>
  <h2 id="rolling">Rolling</h2>
  <p>A die roll is when someone rolls at least one standard six-sided die
    to determine an outcome. A roll of four or higher is a success (a six is
    worth two successes), meaning a three or lower is a failure. The
    “result” of a roll is how many total successes there are. In these
    rules, rolls are indicated in these rules by an <strong>R</strong>,
    followed by a number such as R1, R4, etc.</p>
  <p>Sometimes a roll is specified as “advantaged” which means dice rolls
    succeed on a 3 or higher. Another variant is “disadvantaged” which means
    dice rolls succeed on a 5 or higher. Rolling a 6 is always considered to
    be 2 successes. Advantages and disadvantages both stack, and each
    cancels the other out. Having double advantage means the dice are
    successes on twos or higher.</p>
  <p>Rolls can be used to determine damage, healing, or checks of your
    abilities. The weapon, trick, or GM will describe what you are trying to
    accomplish and what attribute you will be using. If your GM calls for a
    Dexterity roll (perhaps you’ve activated a trap!), you would roll a
    number of dice equal to your dexterity score, and count your
    successes.</p>
  <h2 id="trick">Trick</h2>
  <p>Something that a character is able to do which isn’t an aspect of
    their normal self. This works for lots of settings, from flashbangs to
    spells to traps</p>
  <h2 id="damage-types">Damage Types</h2>
  <p>SOLAS contains many different damage types for different weapons and
    tricks. This list can be expanded upon for your needs, but the standard
    categories as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical</strong>: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing</li>
    <li><strong>Elemental</strong>: Acid, Fire, Cold, Lightning</li>
    <li><strong>Celestial</strong>: Radiant, Necrotic, Force, Psychic</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="point-pools">Point Pools</h2>
  <p>These are points you can save up to spend attacking, moving, or doing
    tricks. When combat ends, these are returned to their maximum.</p>
  <p><strong>Focus</strong> is your mental concentration at any given
    moment. These points are used up when you use tricks, and some are given
    back at the start of each turn. The upper limit of this is your Mind
    score.</p>
  <p><strong>Stamina</strong> is your physical ablness at any given
    moment. These points are used up when you move or attack, and some are
    given back at the start of each turn. The standard limit of this is
    3.</p>
  <h2 id="primary-attributes">Primary Attributes</h2>
  <p>Characters in the game have different categories to describe their
    areas of expertise. The number associated with each attribute is its
    relative effectiveness, 1 being the minimum possible. The categories are
    as follows:</p>
  <p><strong>Strength</strong> <em>Natural athleticism, physical
      power</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Effectiveness with melee weapons.</li>
    <li>What armor you can wear.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Dexterity</strong> <em>Physical agility, reflexes,
      precision</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Speed</strong>: How fast your character is, 4 tiles plus
      <strong>dexterity</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>Effectiveness with ranged weapons.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Mind</strong> <em>Analytical skill, intuition</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Focus</strong>: Your mental concentration on a trick. Your
      <strong>Mind</strong> is the maximum.
    </li>
    <li>How powerful the tricks you can use are.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Constitution</strong> <em>Physical/Mental toughness,
      persistance</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>How rapidly you can physically/mentally recover from exertion. At
      the start of your turn, your <strong>Constitution</strong> gets added
      back to your amounts of <strong>Focus</strong> and
      <strong>Stamina</strong>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Heart</strong>: How much character can take before falling,
      <strong>Constitution</strong> times Level, plus 5.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="tiles">Tiles</h2>
  <p>A tile is typically a square or hexagon on a grid, and is considered
    to be 5 feet (or 1.5 meters). While you may not be playing with an
    actual grid at all, this still describes specific distances for tricks,
    ranges, and movement.</p>
  <h1 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h1>
  <p>To play this game, each player must create a character, a member of
    the setting that the GM is describing. SOLAS is designed to have very a
    simple character creation system, but one that lets creativity run wild.
    The easiest way to create a character is to break it down into two
    parts: Before they became an adventurer, and where they are now. Doing
    this naturally flows with the character creation process. The first step
    is…</p>
  <h2 id="backgrounds">Backgrounds</h2>
  <p>Think about what makes your GM’s setting different from the world you
    live in. There may be fantastical races, parts of the world still yet
    unexplored, or conflict between groups. These are shaping elements, and
    change the people who experience them.</p>
  <p>So how does this affect your character? Think about where they come
    from, what sort of upbringing they had, what are values that were
    instilled in them? All of these help to form a full character who really
    lives in the world and isn’t just an observer.</p>
  <p><em>Select <strong>one</strong> of the following backgrounds for your
      character</em></p>
  <h3 id="athlete">Athlete</h3>
  <p>You have advantage on <strong>Strength</strong> checks.</p>
  <p><em>You’ve been raised to depend on your physical strength, in and
      out of combat.</em></p>
  <h3 id="far-traveler">Far Traveler</h3>
  <p>You have advantage on <strong>Constitution</strong> checks.</p>
  <p><em>You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the
      common folk realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if
      some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the
      name and perhaps a few outrageous tales.</em></p>
  <h3 id="runaway">Runaway</h3>
  <p>You have advantage on <strong>Dexterity</strong> checks.</p>
  <p><em>Staying on the outskirts of society, you had no one to watch over
      you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself.
      You’ve survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength,
      speed, or some combination of each.</em></p>
  <h3 id="sage">Sage</h3>
  <p>You have advantage on <strong>Mind</strong> checks.</p>
  <p><em>You’ve spent your time pouring over every detail in your area of
      research, memorizing every intricacy of the field.</em></p>
  <h2 id="lineages">Lineages</h2>
  <p>There are many different kinds of people, and in your GM’s setting,
    there may be far more, from humans to animals to deities, and everything
    in between. Your character may reflect some of these differences, either
    directly or somewhere far back in their ancestry.</p>
  <p><em>Select <strong>one</strong> of the following lineages for your
      character</em></p>
  <h3 id="celestial-ancestor">Celestial Ancestor</h3>
  <p>You are resistant to one celestial damage type (Radiant, Necrotic,
    Force, or Psychic) of your choice, which cannot be changed later. You
    also roll with advantage when attacking with this type of damage.</p>
  <p><em>Your power may come from deities, psions, or something else
      entirely. This usually manifests in a shifted palette, gold for
      celestials, reds for devils, purples for psions, etc.</em></p>
  <h3 id="darkvision">Darkvision</h3>
  <p>You have superb vision in the dark, being raised in it or naturally
    gifted. Your character can see up to 6 tiles away in darkness, in shades
    of gray.</p>
  <p><em>This may manifest if the form of non-human eyes, such as cat
      pupils or glowing irises.</em></p>
  <h3 id="elemental-ancestor">Elemental Ancestor</h3>
  <p>You are resistant to one elemental damage type (Poison, Fire, Cold,
    or Lightning) of your choice, which cannot be changed later. You also
    roll with advantage when attacking with this type of damage.</p>
  <p><em>Your power may come from primordials, dragons, or something else
      entirely. This usually manifests in a shifted palette, dealing in reds
      and oranges for fire, etc.</em></p>
  <h3 id="lucky">Lucky</h3>
  <p>Once per rest when you make a roll, you may re-roll all of the dice.
    You must use the new result.</p>
  <h3 id="twilit">Twilit</h3>
  <p>You no longer need to sleep to fully recover heart, instead only
    requiring 4 hours of concious meditation.</p>
  <p><em>This may be the result of exposure to the feywild, underdark, or
      similar place. Your skin may sparkle in the right light, some
      animalistic features may manifest (satyrs, for example), flowers may
      bloom/wilt around you depending on your mood, or similar
      flavoring.</em></p>
  <h2 id="leveling">Leveling</h2>
  <p>When you’ve just created your character and you have your
    background(s)/lineage(s) chosen, your character is at level zero. Of
    course, you can’t play the game this way, so you need to level up!</p>
  <p>Every time you level up, you will add a point to one of your primary
    attributes (<strong>Strength</strong>, <strong>Dexterity</strong>,
    <strong>Mind</strong>, or <strong>Constitution</strong>). Furthermore,
    you also gain a <strong>Boon</strong> every three levels, starting at
    level one (four, seven, ten, etc.)
  </p>
  <h2 id="boons">Boons</h2>
  <p>A boon is something that is a unique skill that shapes how your
    character interacts with the world, that they have acquired throughout
    their journey. Some boons have requirements, and characters that do not
    meet these cannot recieve the boon.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Basic Boons:</strong> These do not have
      requirements</em></p>
  <h3 id="adrenaline">Adrenaline</h3>
  <p>You are able to push your body beyond its normal limits for a short
    time. Once per rest at the start of your turn, you can use recover an
    additional stamina point.</p>
  <h3 id="blink">Blink</h3>
  <p>You can use the <strong>Misty Step</strong> trick once per rest with
    no <strong>Focus</strong> cost (still costs 1
    <strong>Stamina</strong>).
  </p>
  <h3 id="duelist">Duelist</h3>
  <p>Once per round when you are hit with a melee attack, you can spend
    some or all of your remaining stamina points to reduce the damage by
    that much</p>
  <h3 id="elemental-shift">Elemental Shift</h3>
  <p>When you attack with a physical weapon, you can spend one
    <strong>focus</strong> to randomly change its damage type to an
    elemental one. This effect persists through combat, and you can spend
    another point to roll the type again. To do determine the damage type,
    roll a d6:
  </p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>No change, the damage type is the normal one for the weapon</li>
    <li>Poison</li>
    <li>Fire</li>
    <li>Cold</li>
    <li>Lightning</li>
    <li>Your choice of an elemental damage type</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3>
  <p>Once per rest on your turn, you can inspire another creature. By
    spending one <strong>Focus</strong>, the target creature can roll an
    additional die for one roll. Once the extra dice is used (or the
    creature rests), the inspiration fades.</p>
  <h3 id="last-stand">Last Stand</h3>
  <p>While you are fading, you do not have to spend an additional heart to
    take your turn.</p>
  <h3 id="rage">Rage</h3>
  <p>If you aren’t wearing armor, you can use a <strong>Focus</strong> to
    channel your primal ferocity. You get advantage on melee attack rolls,
    and all physical attacks have disadvantage against you. While you are
    raging, however, you do not recover <strong>Focus</strong> at the start
    of your turns.</p>
  <h3 id="sacrifice">Sacrifice</h3>
  <p>After a roll, you can choose to lose some of your remaining HP to
    increase the roll by that amount.</p>
  <h3 id="soul-collector">Soul Collector</h3>
  <p>If you reduce a creature’s heart, you recover additional
    <strong>Focus</strong> or <strong>Stamina</strong> at the start of your
    next turn. Recover your normal amount, then also roll R1 and distribute
    the successes as points.
  </p>
  <h3 id="warcaster">Warcaster</h3>
  <p>If your <strong>heart</strong> is reduced while you are concentrating
    on a trick, you may roll a <strong>Constitution</strong> check. If you
    roll more successes than damage that you took</p>
  <h3 id="well-armored">Well Armored</h3>
  <p>Your <strong>strength</strong> is considered to be one higher when
    meeting an armor requirement</p>
  <h3 id="willbreaker">Willbreaker</h3>
  <p>When you do damage to a creature and its resistance drops to 0, you
    can spend focus points to roll further psychic damage against it, 1R per
    focus point.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Upgraded Boons:</strong> Require other boons, a high
      enough primary stat, etc.</em></p>
  <h3 id="frenzy">Frenzy</h3>
  <p><em>Requires <strong>Rage</strong></em></p>
  <p>While you’re raging, you can make a second attack with a weapon
    (costing another <strong>Stamina</strong> point). When combat ends, you
    become exhausted, having disadvantage on all checks and your speed
    becoming halved until you rest.</p>
  <h3 id="combat-inspiration">Combat Inspiration</h3>
  <p><em>Requires <strong>Inspiration</strong></em></p>
  <p>Instead of giving <strong>Inspiration</strong> on your turn, you can
    now give it at any point (up to immediately after a roll, which it can
    be used to improve), provided that you have enough
    <strong>Focus</strong> to use it. Additionally, the inspiration can now
    be used to reduce the damage of an attack (at a minimum of 0 damage,
    inspiration cannot heal)
  </p>
  <h3 id="glory">Glory</h3>
  <p><em>Requires <strong>Last Stand</strong></em></p>
  <p>While you are fading, all damage rolls are made with advantage.</p>
  <h3 id="second-wind">Second Wind</h3>
  <p><em>Requires <strong>Adrenaline</strong></em></p>
  <p>Once per rest at the start of your turn, you may recover
    <strong>Focus</strong> or <strong>Stamina</strong> points (or a mix of
    the two) equal to your level.
  </p>
  <h1 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h1>
  <p>Most TTRPGs are broken down into a cycle of play, but this is by no
    means a one-size fits all solution. Generally, a GM will describe the
    environment, and the players respond with what their character does. The
    GM then goes back and forth with the players, narrating the results of
    their actions and having the players respond, until a scene comes to a
    natural close.</p>
  <h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
  <p>Struggle is a part of every story, and it may present itself in the
    form of combat. Your characters have specific strengths and weaknesses
    based on your primary attributes. To start combat, everybody (including
    the GM’s characters) make dexterity checks, where play goes highest to
    lowest according to the number of successes (this can be changed to play

  <h3 id="on-a-turn">On a Turn</h3>
  <p>It’s your time! Your character starts their turn by recovering some
    of their <strong>Focus</strong> and <strong>Stamina</strong> points (up
    to their maximum). You can then use any number of your remaining stamina
    or focus points, by taking any of the following actions:</p>

  <h3 id="resistancesweaknesses">Resistances/Weaknesses</h3>
  <p>Some enemies or characters may be resistant or weak to certain types
    of damage (see <strong>Damage Types</strong> in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>. If something is weak
    to a type of
    attack, count your successes with advantage. If something is resistant
    to the type of attack, count the successes with disadvantage.</p>
  <h3 id="fading">Fading</h3>
  <p>Once your character reaches 0 heart, you begin fading. This means
    your character is losing their grip on mortality, and will soon die.
    Once you reach 0 heart, continuing to fight is dangerous. At the start
    of each of your turns, you lose a heart. Additionally, you can choose to
    lose an extra heart to take your normal turn, being any number of
    actions up to your current stamina/focus. Once you reach -5 heart, your
    character falls and dies.</p>
  <h2 id="resting">Resting</h2>
  <p>Once combat comes to a close, your focus and stamina are restored.
    However, your characters cannot stay awake indefinitely, and will need
    to recover from the physical exertion of the battle. Characters will
    need to rest for a total of 8 hours, up to two of which can be
    sitting/lying down. If characters go 24 hours without resting, they
    receive disadvantage on all checks due to exhaustion, and their speed is
    halved.</p>
  <h1 id="weapons">Weapons</h1>
  <p>These are physical implements of destruction. For weapons, their
    damage is based off of your associated Primary Attribute. Melee weapons
    are based on strength, ranged ones on dexterity. While your primary
    attribute is affecting how many dice that you roll, some weapons can be
    specially made, being +1 or higher. This indicates to roll an extra dice
    when attacking with the weapon. While most standard weapons fall into
    the physical (bludgeoning, piercing, slashing) category, some special
    weapons could be of a different damage type.</p>
  <p>Each weapon that is held can be used once per turn.</p>
  <h2 id="melee-weapons">Melee Weapons</h2>

    cost, regardless of the damage dealt. If you don’t have enough focus OR
