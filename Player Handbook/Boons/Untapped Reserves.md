# [Untapped Reserves](Untapped%20Reserves.md)
You gain a reservoir of points equal to your **Constitution Score**. These points can be spent like **Stamina**, and for the same actions. However, these do not recover at the start of your turn, only when you finish a rest.

_The Untapped Reserves within you represent the latent energy awaiting release through disciplined mastery. As a duelist, you can harness this to perform extraordinary feats, unleashing a torrent of swift strikes, unparalleled agility and speed, and other abilities that set you apart as a true master of the disciplined arts. With focused meditation while resting, your reserves points replenish, ensuring a wellspring of untapped potential whenever the call to action arises._
