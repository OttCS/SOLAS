# [Unarmored Defense](Unarmored%20Defense.md)
If you are not wearing armor, your freedom of movement improves your ability to dodge incoming attacks. Add your dexterity and constitution, and half it. Treat this as how much "strength" you have, and consider the armor section. You have damage resistance equal to the level of armor you would be able to wear.
