# [Rage](Rage.md)
On your turn, you can use **One Focus** to rage. While raging, you have advantage on all strength checks, but you do not recover spent focus. Your rage ends when you do not take damage from the start of one turn to the end of the next. Additionally, if you are not wearing armor, you can reduce incoming physical damage by one per attack (as if you were wearing light armor).

*Fueled by an inner fury, you can tap into the raw, untamed power coursing through you. As you enter a state of rage, your senses sharpen, and a ferocious determination takes hold. Stripped of armor, you become a living tempest, deflecting incoming attacks with sheer might.*

# Upgrades
When you are selecting a boon, you can instead choose one of the following upgrades, provided you have previously taken [Rage](Rage.md)

## Might of the Berserker
While raging: Your advantage on all strength checks now encompasses your physical melee attacks, and your damage reduction is increased to two (as if you were wearing medium armor). Furthermore, you can now spend a focus point in response to taking any damage, reducing the incoming attack by the successes of a **Strength Check**.

*Through pushing your rage to new levels, you can now unleash a more chaotic, unpredictable anger on your foes. While in this enhanced state, your tolerance reaches new thresholds, and your attacks carve through your enemies indiscriminately.*
