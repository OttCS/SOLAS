# [Hand to Hand](Hand%20to%20Hand.md)
Your unarmed strikes (punches, kicks, etc) are considered to be light melee weapons, and can be attacked with by spending a **focus point** rather than stamina. Additionally, any creatures grappled by you take R2 bludgeoning damage at the start of your turn, rolled at advantage.

*You have honed your body into a lethal weapon, capable of delivering flurried strikes to break down enemies' resolves. Your mental focus on these strikes set you apart from other fighters, leaving your enemies reeling from your martial mastery.*

# Upgrades
When you are selecting a boon, you can instead choose one of the following upgrades, provided you have previously taken [Rage](Rage.md)

### Aspect of the Storm
While raging, the area around you (2 tile radius) becomes stormy, based on a harsh and unforgiving environment, and all speed in this radius is halved (excluding yours). You can spend a stamina point to deal damage equal to the successes of a strength check. The type of this damage is selected from the **elemental** damage types when you select this boon, and can be changed immediately after a rest.

*Your rage warps the area immediately around you, transforming the ground and air into a harsh and unforgiving environment. It may become blisteringly hot like a desert, stormy like the sea, or biting cold like the tundra.*
