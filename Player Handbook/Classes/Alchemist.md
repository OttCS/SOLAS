# [Alchemist](Player%20Handbook/Classes/Alchemist.md)
Masters of the eldritch concoctions and divine elixirs, stand as the conduits between the cosmic forces of creation and the mortal realm. These divine artisans channel their mental and physical will into their craft, creating concoctions or contraptions to shape the world around them.

# Boons

## Primary Boons
These can be taken without any prerequisites, being introductions to the Alchemist class.

### Arcane Infusion
You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. You can touch a nonmagical object, spending one **Focus** to give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

- **Boots of Speed**, infused to increase the wearer's speed by 1 tile
- **Armor of Strength**, infused to give the wearer advantage on **Strength** checks
- **Helm of Awareness**, infused to give the wearer advantage on **Mind** checks
- **Gloves of Persuasion**, act as light melee weapons that deal an additional R1 force damage
- **Radiant Weapon**. The infused item deals radiant damage instead of the usual type, and can emit light in a 6 tile radius. Once per rest, the wielder can use one **Focus** to blind a melee target, giving them disadvantage on any rolls until the end of the target's next turn

The chosen property lasts indefinitely, and you can end the property at will. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your **Constitution** score.

### Divine Healer
You have a pool of healing ability you can draw from. After every rest, your pool has a number of points equal to your **Focus + Constitution**. On your turn, you may spend **One Stamina** and **One Focus** to use a point, and provide **R3 healing** to a creature within 6 Tiles. If you touch the creature while using this, you may use advantage when rolling.

## Secondary Boons
You must have at least one of the **Alchemist Primary Boons** to gain one of these.

### Spark of Vitality
Your maximum focus becomes equal to your **Mind + Constitution**, ensuring that your sheer will to keep going is reflected in your spellcasting ability.

*Your indomitable will and unwavering determination have been forged into your very being, becoming the beating heart of your spellcasting prowess. As you channel arcane energy, the resilience within you manifests, ensuring that your magical abilities mirror the tenacity with which you face the challenges that lie ahead.*
