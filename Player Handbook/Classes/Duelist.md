## Primary Boons
These can be taken without any prerequisites, being introductions to the Duelist class.

### Finesse
When wearing light or no armor, you may use dexterity for damage rolls with light or medium melee weapons, and may also spend **one Focus** to impose disadvantage on attack rolls against you by a creature within melee range.

_Mastering the art of dueling, you weave through battle with agile precision, your dexterity infusing each strike with deadly finesse. As adversaries close in, your focus sharpens, allowing you to anticipate and deflect their attacks, turning each duel into a choreographed dance of swift strikes and evasive maneuvers._

### Untapped Reserves
You gain a reservoir of points equal to your **Mind Score**. These points can be spent like **Stamina**, and for the same actions. However, these do not recover at the start of your turn, only when you finish a rest.

_The Untapped Reserves within you represent the latent energy awaiting release through disciplined mastery. As a duelist, you can harness this to perform extraordinary feats, unleashing a torrent of swift strikes, unparalleled agility and speed, and other abilities that set you apart as a true master of the disciplined arts. With focused meditation while resting, your reserves points replenish, ensuring a wellspring of untapped potential whenever the call to action arises._
