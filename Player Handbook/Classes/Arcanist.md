# Boons

## Primary Boons
These can be taken by anyone.

### Innate Arcana
You permanently memorize one **Primary Spell**, which costs one **Focus** as opposed to the normal two. This does not count against your total number of memorized spells.

*Etched into the very fabric of your being, the Innate Arcana manifests as a wellspring of mystical knowledge, yielding one paramount spell that requires less effort to invoke. This singular enchantment, a testament to your profound connection with the arcane, becomes an intrinsic part of your magical repertoire, a beacon of power that sets you apart in the realm of spellcasters.*

### Warcaster
If your **heart** is reduced while concentrating on a spell, roll a **Mind** check against the damage suffered. On a successful check, you maintain concentration on the spell.

*The Warcaster's bond with their magic transcends the physical toll of battle. As their heart wavers under the strain, a surge of indomitable will allows them to defy the pain, clutching onto the threads of concentration amidst chaos. This arcane resilience transforms each battle into a testament of their unyielding connection to the mystic forces they command.*

## Secondary Boons
You must have at least one of the **Arcanist Primary Boons** to gain one of these.

### Spellbound
You gain the ability to temporarily bind an additional spell to your mind, allowing you to cast it without the need for conventional spell memorization. Once per rest, you can replace a prepared spell with another, which remains until your next rest.

*The arcane energies wrap around your consciousness like an ethereal chain, linking you to an additional spell that dances at the edge of your mind's grasp. Spellbound, you are a living grimoire, capable of seamlessly integrating new magical knowledge into your repertoire. As dawn breaks, the ephemeral bindings fade, leaving you ready to embrace a fresh array of spells with each passing day.*
