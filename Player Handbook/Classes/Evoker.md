# [Evoker](Player%20Handbook/Classes/Evoker.md)
Wielders of primal strength and cosmic destruction who harness the raw, untamed power coursing through the natural and supernatural realms. They manifest the powers of creation and destruction through their unbreakable physical and mental strength.

# Boons

## Primary Boons
These can be taken without any prerequisites, being introductions to the Evoker class.

### Cosmic Compendium
You have advantage on **Mind Checks** regarding anatomical/biological knowledge about creatures, as well as tracking. You can elect to spend **one Focus** to glean tactical insight about a creature within sight, the Game Master revealing a random resistance or weakness.

_Your knowledge of the world around you is bolstered by your connection to the natural and supernatural realms, allowing you to be a valuable ally and a dangerous enemy._

### Stellar Impact
When making a melee attack, you can spend **one Focus** point to add the successes of a **Mind Check** to the damage.

_As you swing your weapon, the strength within you draws upon the source of mystical power, guiding your strike unerringly. Your weapon becomes a conduit for cosmic might, delivering a blow that resonates with the forces of creation and destruction._

## Secondary Boons
You must have at least one of the **Evoker Primary Boons** to gain one of these.

### Mark of the Cosmos
Your maximum focus is equal to your **Mind + Strength**, but does not increase the number nor difficulty of spells you can memorize.

_Through cosmic favor or a part of your soul that has been devoted to a force in the cosmos, physical strength is the catalyst for your magical prowess. When using large amounts of Focus, your eyes and veins may begin to glow, your voice backed by the subsonic rumble of the ground around you._
