Armor is an important thing for any adventurer to consider:

**2 Strength**
*Light armor is capable of warding off some damage. Fabric/cloth/leathers/hides are found in this category.*
- Reduces physical damage by 1

**4 Strength**
*Medium armor is capable of warding off a decent amount of damage, but begins to impact your mobility. Expect to find breastplates, chainmail, and lighter metals.*
- Reduces physical damage by 2
- Reduces your speed by 1 tile

**6 Strength**
*The heaviest armor around, which can completely mitigate lighter attacks. This severely reduces your mobility, but who needs to move if nobody can hurt you?*
- Reduces physical damage by 3
- Reduces your speed by 2 tiles
