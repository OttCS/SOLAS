Armor is an important thing for any adventurer to consider, but not everyone is capable of wearing it. The listed strength requirements are what your strength must be for you to effectively wear the armor.

**2 Strength**

*Light armor is capable of warding off some damage. Fabric/cloth/leathers/hides are found in this category.*

- Reduces physical damage by 1
- Reduces your speed by 1 tile

**4 Strength**

*Medium armor is capable of warding off a decent amount of damage, but begins to impact your mobility. Expect to find breastplates, chainmail, and lighter metals.*

- Reduces physical damage by 2
- Reduces your speed by 2 tiles

**6 Strength**

*The heaviest armor around, which can completely mitigate lighter attacks. This severely reduces your mobility, but who needs to move if nobody can hurt you?*

- Reduces physical damage by 3
- Reduces your speed by 3 tiles

## Shields
A shield can also be held in one one to reduce incoming physical damage by 1 without reducing your speed.
