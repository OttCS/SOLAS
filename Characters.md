To play this game, each player must create a character, a member of the setting that the GM is describing. SOLAS is designed to have very a simple character creation system, but one that lets creativity run wild. The easiest way to create a character is to break it down into two parts: Before they became an adventurer, and where they are now. Doing this naturally flows with the character creation process. The first step is...

## Backgrounds
Think about what makes your GM's setting different from the world you live in. There may be fantastical races, parts of the world still yet unexplored, or conflict between groups. These are shaping elements, and change the people who experience them.

So how does this affect your character? Think about where they come from, what sort of upbringing they had, what are values that were instilled in them? All of these help to form a full character who really lives in the world and isn't just an observer.

*Select **one** of the following backgrounds for your character*

### Athlete
You have advantage on **Strength** checks.

*You've been raised to depend on your physical strength, in and out of combat.*

### Far Traveler
You have advantage on **Constitution** checks.

*You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous tales.*

### Lucky
Once per rest when you make a roll, you may re-roll all of the dice. You must use the new result.

*You've had close brushes with danger and doom, but you're always able to get out of tough situations in the nick of time.*

### Runaway
You have advantage on **Dexterity** checks.

*Staying on the outskirts of society, you had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.*

### Sage
You have advantage on **Mind** checks.

*You've spent your time pouring over every detail in your area of research, memorizing every intricacy of the field.*

## Lineages
There are many different kinds of people, and in your GM's setting, there may be far more, from humans to animals to deities, and everything in between. Your character may reflect some of these differences, either directly or somewhere far back in their ancestry.

*Select **one** of the following lineages for your character*

### Celestial Ancestor
You are resistant to one celestial damage type (Radiant, Necrotic, Force, or Psychic) of your choice, which cannot be changed later. You also roll with advantage when attacking with this type of damage.

*Your power may come from deities, psions, or something else entirely. This usually manifests in a unique bodily color palette, golds for celestials, reds for devils, purples for psions, etc.*

### Darkvision
You have superb vision in the dark, being raised in it or naturally gifted. Your character can see up to 6 tiles away in darkness, in shades of gray.

*This may manifest if the form of non-human eyes, such as cat pupils, glowing irises, etc*

### Elemental Ancestor
You are resistant to one elemental damage type (Acid, Poison, Fire, Cold, or Lightning) of your choice, which cannot be changed later. You also roll with advantage when attacking with this type of damage.

*Your power may come from primordial beings, dragons, or something else entirely. This usually manifests in a unique bodily color palette, with reds and oranges for fire, etc.*

### Fey Ancestry
You no longer need to sleep to fully recover heart, instead only requiring 4 hours of conscious meditation. As a result of this, magic cannot put you to sleep. Furthermore, you have advantage on **Mind checks** against spell effects.

*This may be the result of exposure to the feywild, underdark, or similar place. Your skin may sparkle in the right light, some animalistic features may manifest (satyrs, for example), flowers may bloom/wilt around you depending on your mood, or you may even represent aspects of nature like seasons.*

### Innate Arcana
You permanently memorize one **Primary Spell**, which costs one **Focus** as opposed to the normal two.

*Your ancestry has been touched by magic, having a natural gift of spell usage. This can come from all sorts of places, from planar magic to deities, a natural connection or a deliberate augmentation.*

### Runewoven
When casting a spell, you can use a combination of **heart** or **focus** points to equal the original cost. Likewise, when you're healed, you can regain a combination of **heart** or **focus** points instead of just heart. Once per rest when you lose **heart**, you can instead choose to lose a combination of **heart** or **focus** points that is equal to the original amount.

*Your connection to magic is much more than knowledge, it's what keeps you alive. This could manifest as runic etchings carved into your skin/exterior, a cracked appearance with a dull glow coming through, etc.*

## Attributes and Scores
When you've started your character and you have your background(s)/lineage(s) chosen, start your character with one point in each of your **Primary Attributes**, then add one point to the attribute of your choice.

You then must figure out your other scores. Referring back to the **Primary Attributes** section:

### Strength
Your **strength** limits what **armor** you can wear. Ask your DM if you are allowed to start with armor, or if armor will be available in their setting.

### Dexterity
Your **dexterity** affects your **speed**. This is equal to four plus your **dexterity** score.

### Constitution
Your **constitution** affects your **heart** (also referred to as health and/or hit points). This is equal to your **constitution** score times your level, plus five.

### Mind
Your **mind** score is your amount of **focus** (the amount of which you have at the start of combat).

Your **mind** also affects what spells you know. A character can only memorize a certain number of spells at a time, this being your **mind**. The ones you have memorized can be swapped during rests, but if you don't have a spell prepared, you cannot use it. Characters with a **Mind** score higher than one can use **spells**, so check out the section to make sure you know your character's options.

## Leveling Up
After some progression in the story, your GM may decide that it is time for your characters to become stronger! You get to add another point to one of your primary attributes (**Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Mind**, or **Constitution**), and if at an appropriate level you also recieve another **Boon**!

## Additional Ways of Play
Ways to spice up the game, each benefit has tradeoffs

### Lycanthropy
You have the power to transform into a hybrid of man and beast. Hide/Scales/Fur may appear all over your body, and your lack of inhibition only turns you into a more ferocious predator.
- Even when not in your bestial form, you have advantage on **mind checks** relating to perception.
- You can transform at will between your normal human form and your bestial form, but doing so **costs R1 heart**.
- When in your bestial form, you gain advantage on melee attacks made with claws, and you have the melee option to bite.
- When in your bestial form, your melee attacks are rolled with advantage.
- At the end of each of your turns, make a constitution check against the number of creatures you reduced the heart of. If you fail, you enter a frenzy. At the start of each of your turns, you must attack any creatures within melee range (including allies), provided you have available stamina. After this, you may take your turn as normal, making the check again at the end.
