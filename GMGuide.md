# Setting
Whether you're using a real world time and location like prohibition in Boston, adding a twist to a time period like medvieval fantasy, or creating a planet-hopping future, you have to build out at least an idea for a setting. World or universe maps aren't necessary, and are typically not worth the effort put in. Develop first the core concepts of your setting and time period. Is religion prevalent? What level of technology is widely used?

# Adventures
A setting is not enough to explore. An adventure is a way of developing a full story, where the players can affect outcomes and reach their goals. The three main points of an adventure are exploration, social interaction, and combat. Try to make sure that there is intrinsic motivation for the players, like the desire to conquer a great enemy, stop encroaching doom, or even just achieve character growth. Keep in mind the scale of the adventure, if your adventure is going to span a couple hours or years.


# Enemies
Enemies are non-player characters (NPCs) that may attack (or be attacked by) the party. The templates provided below offer scalable stats, so that enemies can be created on the fly. The Party Level (PL) is the average level of the players in the party.

## Creating Enemies
Think about what makes this enemy unique. What do they use to attack? Do they have any tricks? Is there a certain strategy they tend to fall back on? Choose their statistics, keeping in mind the Difficulty scale and what level the party is. A level one party typically cannot do damage to something with a defense of 7 without expending solace. Generally the best practice for creating enemies is just to fill out a character sheet and tweak as needed.

*You do not need to follow the standard character rules here. While the rules help keep balance between characters in a party, enemies don't necessarily play by those same rules. Letting an enemy hit hard with dexterity doesn't mean it has to have an unhittable defense. Use your best judgement between what will challenge your players and be unpleasant for them.*
