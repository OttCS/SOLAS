# Setting
Whether you're using a real world time and location like prohibition in Boston, adding a twist to a time period like medvieval fantasy, or creating a planet-hopping future, you have to build out at least an idea for a setting. World or universe maps aren't necessary, and are typically not worth the effort put in. Develop first the core concepts of your setting and time period. Is religion prevalent? What level of technology is widely used? All of these questions will help both the players and you properly flavor weapons, tricks, and much more.

# Adventures
A setting is not enough to explore. An adventure is a way of developing a full story, where the players can affect outcomes and reach their goals. The three main points of an adventure are exploration, social interaction, and combat. Try to make sure that there is intrinsic motivation for the players, like the desire to conquer a great enemy, stop encroaching doom, or even just achieve character growth. Keep in mind the scale of the adventure, if your adventure is going to span a couple hours or years.

# Challenges
Sometimes your players will want to do something that requires some skill or luck to get it to work. Use the standard chart of abilities to determine which ability would be the most relevant. Feel free as well to request rolls with advantage or disadvantage, according to the character's set of skills, background, or current state.

|Strength|Dexterity|Constitution|Intelligence|Wisdom|Charisma|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Natural athleticism, power|Physical agility, reflexes, precision|Physical/Mental toughness, persistance|Analytical skill, puzzling|Awareness, intuition, practice|Confidence, eloquence, presence|

# Enemies
Enemies are non-player characters (NPCs) that may attack (or be attacked by) the party. The templates provided below offer scalable stats, so that enemies can be created on the fly. The Party Level (PL) is the average level of the players in the party.

## Templates
These are premade, easy-to-flavor enemies that scale well with parties levels 1-6.

### The Brute
*An enemy based on pure physicality*
|Stat|Str|Dex|Con|Int|Wis|Cha|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Score**|+PL|-1|+PL|-3|-2|-2|
**Defense**. PL + 3
**Hit Points**. 2PL + 6
|Options|Name|Stat|Result|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Weapons**|Power Melee|Str|1d6||

### The Strategist
*An enemy focused on dodging and cunning*
|Stat|Str|Dex|Con|Int|Wis|Cha|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Score**|-2|+PL|+0|+PL|-3|-3|
**Defense**. PL + 4
**Hit Points**. PL + 5
|Options|Name|Stat|Result|Notes|

## Creating Enemies
Think about what makes this enemy unique. What do they use to attack? Do they have any tricks? Is there a certain strategy they tend to fall back on? Choose their statistics, keeping in mind the Difficulty scale and what level the party is. A level one party typically cannot do damage to something with a defense of 7 without expending solace. Generally the best practice for creating enemies is just to fill out a character sheet and tweak as needed.

*You do not need to follow the standard character rules here. While the rules help keep balance between characters in a party, enemies don't necessarily play by those same rules. Letting an enemy hit hard with dexterity doesn't mean it has to have an unhittable defense. Use your best judgement between what will challenge your players and be unpleasant for them.*

# Weapons
Throughout the adventure, your players may come across new and interesting weapons. Below is a standard guide for determining the damage of generic weapon types. "A" indicates advantage on a roll (on 1d6, advatage moves the die average from a 3.5 to ~4.5)

|Type|Category|Result|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|**Melee**|Power|1d6 + Str||
||Great Power|A1d6 + Str|Two-Handed|
||Precision|1d6 + Dex||
|**Ranged**|Power|1d6 + Str|R60|
||Precision|1d6 + Dex|R30|
||Heavy Precision|A1d6 + Dex|R60, Two-Handed|

**Improved Weaponry**. A way to reward players in higher level play is to allow them access to improved weaponry. This weaponry may allow them to add a bonus to weapon rolls, another ability score, etc. Some examples are listed below, but others can be homebrewed.

|Type|Category|Result|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|**Melee**|Power +2|1d6 + Str + 2||
||Kinetic Power|A1d6 + Str against two targets|Two-Handed|
|**Ranged**|Practiced Precision|1d6 + Dex + Wis|R30|
||Heavy Splash|A1d6 + Dex against all 5ft from target|R60, Two-Handed|

# Tricks
Tricks can be flavored in any thematic way players or GMs wish, however it should stay consistent with the setting.
