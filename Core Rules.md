*Stats*. These are measures of your character's different strengths and weaknesses. These appear on your character sheet, and are used for attacks/checks, weapons, tools, and tricks of their type.

|Stat|Strength|Dexterity|Constitution|Intelligence|Wisdom|Charisma|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Keyword**|Power|Precision|Persist|Puzzle|Practice|Presence|
|**Description**|Natural athleticism|Physical agility, reflexes|Physical/Mental toughness|Analytical skill|Awareness, intuition|Confidence, eloquence|

Your dexterity is also a measure of how hard you are to hit. Your constitution is also a measure of how much of a hit you can take without lasting damage.

Together, your dexterity and constitution make up your **defense**, and your 3x your constitution is your maximum amount of **health**. Your **solace** is a sacrificable pool of empowerment, determined by 3x your charisma.

# Solace
Comfort in sorrow, misfortune, or distress, **solace** allows you to fudge your way to success, or even to cheat death. Every character has a pool of points called solace that can be used to succeed or reduce pitfalls, but at a steep cost. When a roll is made, you can expend your solace to increase the total by another d6. In the event of damage, you can elect to lose some solace instead of your remaining health. You can only use up to the amount of solace you have left, and when solace is used it is gone until you rest again.

# Characters
*Name, Background, and Personality*. People aren't collections of statistics, and neither should your character be. Flesh out a backstory, what they wear, how they act, physicality, bonds and flaws, etc. Keep in mind the setting that this character is in.

*Archetypes*. General categories of play styles that boost your stats in different areas. These are NOT required to follow exactly, but are a good starting point for character creation. Feel free to just choose two stats, keeping your character's physicality and personality in mind. The associated stats with your archetype get an extra +1 in your stats.

|Stat|Con|Str|Dex|Int|Wis|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Strength**|The Ruler (Forceful power)|
|**Dexterity**|The Explorer (Free discovery)|The Everyman (Grounded talent)|
|**Intelligence**|The Rebel (Cunning outlaw)|The Master (Powerful technique)|The Magician (Crafty intellect)|
|**Wisdom**|The Caregiver (Assisting protector)|The Innocent (Restrained power)|The Lover (Dedicated talent)|The Sage (Learned understanding)|
|**Charisma**|The Leader (Rallying presence)|The Hero (Physical Presence)|The Jester (Channeled fervor)|The Creator (Artistic Solutions)|The Diplomat (Disarming charm)|

## Boons
An area of expertise or talent your character has. These are typically chosen upon leveling up **instead** of selecting a stat increase.

***Brutal***. When you roll at least one 6 on a d6 in an attack, you can add one extra d6.
***Last Stand***. When you are fading, you do an extra d6 of damage.
***Rally Cry***. When you are fading, allies can add your charisma to one roll on their turns.
***Reliable***. When you roll an attack with only ones, you can add one extra d6.
***Sacrifice***. After a roll, you can choose to lose up to your remaining amount of hp. You can add the amount of lost hp to the roll.

# Adventures
Now it's time to embark on your adventure! The GM begins by introducing the world, and describes the scene you currently find yourselves in. At that point, it's up to the **characters** how they interact with the world around them by talking to people, poking around, etc. Try to act in character, describing what *you* do rather than what your character does.

*Options*. Your options are things your character can do when interacting with the world, whether in or out of combat. Weapons can be typically used to damage things and people, tools can be used to interact with other things, and tricks are things that are typically magical, supernatural, or just generally not found in our world.

***Checks***. In the event that a character attempts something that isn't a given (i.e. some difficulty or skill associated with it), the GM can ask for a check of a particular stat. This could be a strength check for moving a bookshelf, a dexterity check to see how you pilot a ship, an intelligence check to see if you can understand an ancient artifact, a charisma check to see if you can convince someone of a lie, you get the picture.

To roll a check, the GM determines the type (strength, wisdom, etc.) and you add your modifier to a d6 roll, then choosing whether or not to expend any solace points.

***Exploration***. Checking out ancient tombs, unmapped planets, an old house said to be haunted, all are examples of exploration. While the **characters** choose where they want to go, it is ultimately up to the GM to decide what are in these places.

***Social Interaction***. Talking to a shopkeeper, coming up with an infiltration plan between characters, or trying to weasle your way out of consequences are all social interaction. It's up to the **characters** what they say, and up to the GM how it plays out.

## Combat
Combat is a common thing in plenty of stories, and can be a great thematic moment for character and story development.

***Initiative***. Everybody (including the GM) rolls 2d6. The player who rolled highest goes first, play continues to the right (including the GM).

***On Your Turn***. There are three options that can be taken on your turn in combat: 1 movement, 1 action, and 1 bonus action.

|Name|Description|Category|
|-|-|-|
|Go Prone|You lay down|Movement/Action|
|Stand Up|From prone, you stand up|Movement/Action|
|Run|You move up to 6 spaces|Movement/Action|
|Hide|You attempt to conceal yourself|Movement/Action|
|Attack|You use a weapon to deal damage|Action|
|Shove|You attempt to knock a creature prone|Action|

***Death and Fading***. Reaching 0 hit point means you are fading, and reaching -6 is truly dead. On each of your turns, you lose one hit point automatically. Doing anything besides staying/**going prone** and ending your turn costs an extra hit point.
