For weapons, their rolls are based off of your associated Primary Attribute. Melee weapons are strength, ranged and dexterity. While your primary attribute is the one mainly affecting the rolls, some weapons can be specially made, being +1 or higher. This indicates to roll an extra dice when attacking with the weapon. Some weapons may even give you advantage on attacks, being something of a legendary nature, or even a different damage type.

There can also be similar bonuses for tricks. The GM can give characters special means of using their tricks, such as staves, seals, etc. These can also be buffed with adding modifiers, advantages with certain damage types, etc.

For melee weapons, characters have the option of wielding their weapon with both hands, giving them a level of advantage to attacks with that weapon.
