# Combat
When planning for combat, balance is always an issue of utmost concern. It leads to more meaningful combat and more fun for the players (usually). As a result, choosing and/or creating enemies for the party that are balanced is extremely important.

The first step is considering your party's level, and how much damage they are doing and how much they can take. Generally, a character at level 1 will be doing 1 point of damage per round, and at level 10 will be doing 5 points of damage (as a loose rule, half of a character's level). Multiply this by the number of players you have, and you have the *damage per round*. Multiply this by the target number of rounds (standard being 3-4), and you've got the total **heart**! You can make some of this amount the starting **resistance**. Some enemies may have a very high resistance but low health, or vice versa.

At this point, you can start defining the stats of the enemy. At level 1, a character typically has 2 health, with around 1-2 resistance. You don't want an enemy to one-shot characters, so an enemy should be rolling 1 + Group Level dice per turn, divided by the number of attacks it will be making per turn. Put this number into the enemy's main attack

**Resistance**: (Strength)
**Heart:** Total Damage per Combat - Resistance
**Stamina**: 3
**Focus**: (Mind)

**Speed**: 3 + Dexterity

**Strength**: -
**Dexterity**: -
**Mind**: -
**Constitution**: Half of player level
