For simplicity's sake, the character creation process begins at "level zero" with a generic character. This character has a 1 in each of the primary attributes.

Each time you gain a level (including level one!) add a point to a primary attribute of your choosing.

When you attack with a physical weapon, you can spend a focus point to change its damage type to an elemental one. This effect persists through combat, and you can spend another focus point to re-roll the type. To do this, roll a d6:

|1|2|3|4|5|6|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|Acid|Fire|Cold|Lightning|Your choice|
