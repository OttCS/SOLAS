# SOLAS Preview
This is a place where I can organize my own thoughts and ideas, but it should let anyone look to see what the future holds for SOLAS.

## Better Boons
We're revamping how boons are organized, to give a better coverage of the four ability scores. Boons will have prerequisite ability scores, each being locked behind a score of two. This helps steer newer players who choose a stat first, and reduces "analysis paralysis" with a lower number of options. However, since this number is quite low, it does not require a total devotion to a build to explore. Upgrades to the boons may be locked behind a score of three, but we'll see.

Going forward, we are creating two boons per ability (Mind will have 3), each utilizing on a secondary ability score. The following is a general breakdown of my current plan, at least when it comes to sorting the 5e classes (which are decent archetypes):

| 5e Martial Class Placement  | Strength        | Dexterity    | Constitution  |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| **Power (Str or Con)**      | Barbarian (Con) | Monk (Str)   | Paladin (Str) |
| **Precision (Dex or Mind)** | Fighter (Dex)   | Rogue (Mind) | Ranger (Mind) |

*The following is a breakdown of casters, mainly according to vibes. Strength being about overwhelming power, dexterity about spellcraft, and constitution about divine presence*

| 5e Casting Class Placement        | Strength | Dexterity | Constitution |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------------ |
| **I feel like these really work** | Sorcerer | Bard      | Cleric       |
| **These... work. Kinda**          | Warlock  | Wizard    | Druid        |

I understand that these aren't *exact perfect* matches for the DnD classes, but breaking it down this way provides a much better way for me to create boons that feel identifiable, and actually encourage secondary stat investment!

This also is to address an issue in SOLAS currently...

## Caster Identity
Spells are currently available for all. While that's nice and leads to just picking your favorites, it kind of clamps down on creativity. If you can always use the best spell, why would you use the second best, even if it fits your character better?

**Master of Magicks** will be a new feature, optional sets of spells that allow players to further dial in their character's identity. Each one will focus on a specific aspect of spellcraft: The sorcerer and warlock lists of 5e are combined to become the [Evoker](../v2/boons/Mind/Evoker.md), the bard and wizard lists are combined into the [Arcanist](../v2/boons/Mind/Arcanist.md), and cleric and druid lists are combined into the [Devotant](../v2/boons/Mind/Devotant.md). These optional spell list expansions will provide unique and tailored experiences for casters looking to improve their incantations.

**Evokers.** Focused on Strength. Since they'll have the ability to melee, spells should be shorter range and improve melee combat effectiveness. Spellblade sort  of type.
**Arcanists.** Focused on Dexterity. With access to long range weapons, spells should be longer range. Likely area of effects that could affect the caster and/or allies to discourage casting on yourself. Arcane cannon type.
**Devotants.** Focused on Constitution. Long range buffs and support, close range defensive. Unique spell scaling option for using heart, as these casters have a lot of it.
