A boon is something that is a unique skill that shapes how your character interacts with the world, that they have acquired throughout their journey. Some boons have requirements, and characters that do not meet these cannot receive the boon.

***You get to choose one boon when you create your character**, as well as an additional boon every three levels after that (levels four, seven, ten, thirteen, sixteen, and nineteen).*

# Basic Boons
*These do not have any prerequisite boons*

## Arcane Infusion
***Upgrades***. *None*

You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. You can touch a nonmagical object, spending one **Focus** to give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

- **Boots of Speed**, infused to increase the wearer's speed by 1 tile
- **Armor of Strength**, infused to give the wearer advantage on **Strength** checks
- **Helm of Awareness**, infused to give the wearer advantage on **Mind** checks
- **Gloves of Persuasion**, act as light melee weapons that deal an additional R1 force damage
- **Radiant Weapon**. The infused item deals radiant damage instead of the usual type, and can emit light in a 6 tile radius. Once per rest, the wielder can use one **Focus** to blind melee target, giving them disadvantage on any rolls until the end of the target's next turn

The chosen property lasts indefinitely, and you can end the property at will. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your **Mind** score.

## Barbarous Rage
***Upgrades***. Extra Attack, Zealous Presence

While you aren't wearing armor, you can use one **Focus** to channel your primal ferocity and rage. While you are raging, you have advantage on all **Strength** checks/rolls (including damage). While raging, you reduce incoming damage by 1 per attack. While you are raging, however, you do not recover **Focus** at the start of your turns. If you do not lose heart in between two of your consecutive turns, your rage ends.

## Bardic Inspiration
***Upgrades***. Combat Inspiration, Font of Inspiration

You can spend one **Focus** and inspire another creature. The target creature can roll an additional die for a roll of their choice. Once the extra die is used (or the creature rests), the inspiration fades. You can use this a number of times per rest, equal to your **Mind** score.

## Divine Healing
***Upgrades***. Divine Domain

Whenever you use a focus point to restore a creature's heart, you may add an additional R1 to the amount of heart restored.

## Druidic
***Upgrades***. Wild Shape

You aren't impeded by the natural world, and can move about it as you please. Non-magical terrain that would normally slow you down does not, and you have advantage to save against magically created or manipulated plants or terrain. Additionally, you have advantage on **Mind Checks** regarding knowledge about plants/animals/beasts and attempts to track enemies.

## Duelist
***Upgrades***. Extra Attack, Movement Master

If you are wearing light or no armor, you can use your dexterity instead of strength when rolling damage with a light or medium melee weapon. Additionally, if you are attacked by a creature within melee range, you can spend one **Focus** to impose disadvantage on the roll.

## Martial Arts
***Upgrades***. Extra Attack, Movement Master, Stunning Strike

Your fists are now considered to be light melee weapons, and you can expend **Focus** points instead of stamina to make attacks with your fists.

## Paladic Presence
***Upgrades***. Extra Attack, Zealous Presence

When you make a melee attack against a creature, you can expend **Focus** points to do additional celestial damage (choose this type when you select this boon, this cannot be changed later). You do an additional R2 of this type for each **Focus** point you spend.

## Ranger's Mark
***Upgrades***. Blood Hunter, Extra Attack, Movement Master

When you reduce a creature's heart, you form a mystical bond with that creature. If you attack another creature or don't attack it on your next turn, the mark vanishes. When you attack that creature again, you roll additional dice equal to your **Constitution** score, the mark vanishing afterward.

## Rogue Agent
***Upgrades***. Extra Attack, Stunning Strike

You have learned to exploit an enemy's moment of weakness. If you have advantage on a melee attack against a creature, you roll additional dice equal to your **Mind** score.

## Second Wind
***Upgrades***. Extra Attack

You push yourself to continue fighting, past the point of what would normally be possible. Once per rest at the start of your turn, you may recover **Focus** or **Stamina** points (or a mix of the two) equal to your level. Additionally, you roll a number of dice equal to your **Constitution** score, and recover the successes as **Heart**.

## Sorcerous Origins
***Upgrades***. Sorcerous Patron

You are able to channel spells using bursts of physical strength, granted to you or your ancestry by a powerful patron. Your maximum amount of **Focus** is equal to your **Mind + Strength**. This does not increase the number of spells you can memorize, nor the difficulty. 

## Warcaster
***Upgrades***. *None*

If your **heart** is reduced while you are concentrating on a spell, you may roll a **Constitution** check. If you roll more successes than damage that you took, you maintain concentration on the spell. Additionally, if you are able to make an attack of opportunity, you can instead use a spell with a range of 1 Tile, with the target being the creature that provoked the opportunity attack. You must have and expend the appropriate amount of **Focus** and **Stamina**.

# Upgraded Boons
*These require certain basic boons to have be taken previously*

## Blood Hunter
You've learned occult rituals that twist the ways of normal magic to help you track down your targets. When you mark a creature, you lose R1 heart, with your blood sacrifice strengthening the bond between you. You choose an elemental or celestial damage type for the nature of the bond when you select this boon.

- **Binding Curse**. When you attack a marked creature, they must make a **Strength Check** equal to the damage they recieved. If they fail, their speed is reduced to 0 until the end of your next turn.
- **Crimson Brand**. If a marked creature is within melee range of you and attacks you or an ally, you can expend any number of **Focus** points you currently have. You roll a number of dice equal to the focus points you expended, the successes being damage to the creature of your mark's type.

## Combat Inspiration
Instead of giving inspiration on your turn, you can now give it at any point (up to immediately after a roll, which it can be used to improve). Additionally, the inspired creature can now use the inspiration die to reduce the damage of an attack.

## Divine Domain
You choose a certain domain, gaining additional power from a higher power associated with it. You can use your domain's features a number of times per rest, equal to your **Mind** score. You expend one **Focus** point when you use a feature.

### Tempest Domain
- **Thunderous Rebuke**. When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can cause them to make a **Dexterity Check vs Your Mind**. They then take R4 Lightning damage (with disadvantage if they succeeded the check).
- **Destructive Wrath**. When you are rolling lightning or force damage, you can gain advantage on the roll.

### Trickery Domain
- **Blessing of the Trickster**. You touch a willing creature, giving them advantage on dexterity checks for an hour
- **Invoke Duplicity**. You can create an illusory duplicate of yourself that lasts for 4 rounds. For this duration, you can take actions, move, and use spells from your duplicate, using focus and stamina as normal.

### War Domain
- **War Priest**. You can make an additional attack with a weapon on your turn, even if you've already attacked with it.
- **Guided Strike**. When you make an attack roll, you can add R2.

## Extra Attack
On your turn, you can make two attacks with one light or medium weapon (both attacks cost a **Stamina** point).

## Font of Inspiration
You can give inspiration dice multiple times per rest, equal to your **Constitution**. These can be given on different turns, or all on the same turn (provided you have enough stamina to do so).

## Movement Master
You can swim and climb at your normal speed. Additionally, you can fall from a number of tiles equal to your **Dexterity** score without taking damage.

## Sorcerous Patron
As your connection to the origin of your power grows, you begin to manifest some of the aspects of it. You can only select one of these, and it cannot be changed later.

### Celestial Patronage
- **Radiant Soul**. Once per rest, you may add your **Strength** score to the number of dice you are rolling for any check.
- **Empowered Healing**. When you or an ally within 1 tile is rolling healing, you can expend **Focus** points to scale their spell.

### Eldritch Patronage
- **Awakened Mind**. You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 6 tiles that can understand at least one language.
- **Entropic Presence**. When you do damage to a creature, you can spend one **Focus** to imbue fear into it. Until the end of your next turn, it had disadvantage on attacks against you.

### Primordial Patronage
- **Elemental Blessing**. When you take damage of an elemental type, you are empowered with that element. Until the end of your next turn, your first time you roll damage of that type, you may roll with advantage.

### Storm Patronage
- **Heart of the Storm**. When you deal lightning damage, storm magic erupts around you, causing creatures within 2 tiles of your choice to make a **Strength Check vs Your Strength** or be pushed back 2 tiles.
- **Tempestuous Magic**. On your turn, you can spend a **Focus** to surround yourself with gusts of wind, flying up to half of your speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Twilight Patronage
- **Hound of Ill Omen**. Once per rest on your turn, you can spend one **Focus** to summon a howling creature formed from shadow within 6 tiles of you. You can spend your **stamina** points to have it move (speed of 6 tiles) or attack (slashing damage, rolled with your **Strength** score).
- **Strength of the Grave**. Once per rest, when damage reduces you to 0 heart, you can spend one **Focus** to make a **Strength check** and recover the successes as heart.

### Undead Patronage
- **Form of Dread**. On your turn, you can spend one **Focus** to change your form into one of pure terror, such as shadowy appearance, elongated limbs, etc, until the end of your next turn. When you reduce a creature's heart, it makes a **Mind Check vs Your Strength**. If that creature fails, it is petrified and cannot move until your form of dread ends.
- **Grave Touch**. Once per turn, you can change the damage type of a melee attack to Necrotic.

## Stunning Strike
When you reduce a creature's heart with a melee weapon, you can spend a **Focus** point to attempt to stun them. The creature makes a **Constitution check**, and if they roll fewer successes than the heart that they lost, they cannot spend any **Stamina** or **Focus** until the end of your next turn.

## Wild Shape
You gain the ability to take on the form of a creature you have seen before. Twice per rest, you may change your form. This form may have a total of 4 + your level points in its primary attributes, but you may choose to use your normal **Mind** score instead of the form's. You do not wear any armor and are unable to use equipment, but you do gain temporary heart equal to your level. When the temporary heart drops to zero (or when you choose), you revert back to your original form.

## Zealous Presence
By spending one **Focus**, you can give a number of creatures (equal to your level) that can hear you advantage on attack rolls and checks until the start of your next turn.
